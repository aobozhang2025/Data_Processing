Synthesis of Mo 2 TiC 2 T x –V Mo . Mo 2 TiC 2 T x –V Mo was prepared using an electrochemical exfoliation process, which was performed in a three-electrode system. Mo 2 TiC 2 T x MXene deposited on a carbon paper electrode acted as the working electrode, and a graphite rod and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The in situ electrochemical exfoliation process was performed by repeating cathode polarization cycles in H 2 SO 4 solution with a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 between 0 and − 0.53 V versus RHE.

Synthesis of Mo 2 TiC 2 T x –Pt SA . Mo 2 TiC 2 T x –Pt SA catalyst was prepared using an in situ electrochemical exfoliation and atom trapping strategy, which was performed in a three-electrode system. Mo 2 TiC 2 T x MXene deposited on carbon paper acted as the working electrode, and Pt foil and an SCE were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The in situ electrochemical deposition process was performed by controlling cathode polarization cycles in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 solution with a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 between 0 and − 0.6 V versus RHE.

Methods Synthesis of Mo 2 TiC 2 T x MXene. First, 1.0 g Mo 2 TiAlC 2 powders were slowly added to an aqueous concentrated HF (45%) solution in a high-density polyethylene beaker. The suspension was constantly stirred for 48 h at 55 °C. The mixture was then washed and centrifuged by Ar de-aerated distilled water several times until the pH of the solution reached 6 to 7. The obtained suspension was freeze-dried at − 49 °C for 24 h to eliminate the water in the solution.
