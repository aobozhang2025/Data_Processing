Preparation of the Ru–zeolite catalysts Prior to ruthenium loading, the zeolite powder was exchanged with NH 4 + , Na + and Cs + . The NH 4 + exchange was performed in an aque- ous solution of ammonia (0.015 M) at room temperature for 16 h (200 ml solution g zeolite −1 ). The Na + form was obtained from the NH 4 + zeolite via two successive ion-exchange steps at room temperature lasting 16 h each, using 100 ml of 1.0 M aqueous solution of NaCl per 1 g of dry zeolite. Furthermore, the Cs + form was obtained after two successive room temperature ion-exchange steps (48 h and 72 h) with a 0.1 M aqueous solution of caesium acetate (25 ml g −1 ). For each exchange step, the zeolite powder was recuperated via centrifugation, washed with water and air dried at 80 °C (ref. 45). Finally, the zeolites were loaded with 0.2 wt% Ru by ion exchange after adding 1 g of the Cs–zeolite to 100 ml aqueous solution contain- ing the required amount of ruthenium precursor, Ru(NH 3 ) 6 Cl 3 . After 24 h, the zeolite powder was filtered, washed once with distilled water and dried at 50 °C.
