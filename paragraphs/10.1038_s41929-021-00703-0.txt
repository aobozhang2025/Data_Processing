Methods Preparation of α-MnO 2 nanofibres. In a typical procedure for synthesizing α-MnO 2 nanofibres, 0.02 mol of MnSO 4 ‧ 5H 2 O (analytical reagent, AR), 0.02 mol of (NH 4 ) 2 S 2 O 8 (AR) and 0.06 mol of K 2 SO 4 (AR) were dissolved in 70 ml H 2 O. After vigorous stirring for 1 h, the mixture was transferred to an autoclave and heated at 140 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the as-obtained dark brown powders were washed five times with deionized water, separated via vacuum filtration and dried overnight in an oven at 80 °C.

Preparation of the Ru/MnO 2 nanofibres. In a typical procedure, 1.15 mmol of MnO 2 nanofibres were dispersed in 20 ml H 2 O and sonicated for 30 min. A certain amount of RuCl 3 ‧ xH 2 O (AR) was dissolved in 20 ml of H 2 O. The RuCl 3 solution was injected into the MnO 2 suspension at room temperature under vigorous stirring. The reaction was continued for 12 h. The products were then collected by vacuum filtration and washed several times with deionized water. After drying in an oven at 80 °C, the products obtained were further annealed at 200 °C for 1 h in air. RuCl 3 concentrations of 2.41, 4.82 and 19.28 mmol l−1 were used for 4Ru/MnO 2 , 6Ru/MnO 2 and 12Ru/MnO 2 , respectively, with accurate Ru percentages at 3.8, 5.8 and 11.6 (determined by ICP-OES analysis).

Preparation of the homemade RuO 2 . In a typical procedure, 0.75 g RuCl 3 ‧ xH 2 O (AR) was dissolved in a 140 ml mixed solution containing H 2 O and methanol solution (v/v = 1:1). Then 1 M KOH was injected into the RuCl 3 solution to control the pH at approximately 7. After stirring for 1 h, the precipitate was collected via centrifugation and washed five times in a water and ethanol (v/v = 1:1) solution. After drying overnight at 80 °C, the black powder obtained was annealed at 500 °C for 5 h in air.
