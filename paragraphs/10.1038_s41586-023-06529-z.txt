Synthesis of PCN Bulk PCN was prepared by calcining dicyandiamide at 550 °C (2.3 °C min −1 heating rate) in a crucible for 3 h in static air. Exfoliated PCN was obtained by thermal exfoliation at 500 °C (5 °C min −1 heating rate) for 5 h in static air. The exfoliation procedure was repeated several times until the PCN was exfoliated efficiently.

Synthesis of Cu g /PCN CuCl 2 (0.64 g) and exfoliated PCN (0.70 g) were dispersed in 200 ml for- mamide, sonicated for 10 min and then stirred in an oil bath (120 °C) for 12 h, following centrifugation and washing thoroughly by ethanol several times. The oven-dried powder (80 °C) was subsequently heated to 500 °C with a heating rate of 2 °C min −1 and kept for 5 h with the protection of N 2 flow. Cu 1 /PCN with Cu contents of 0.2, 0.9, 1.8, 8.0 and 10.8 wt% were prepared using 0.2, 1.0, 2.0, 10.0 and 15.0 wt% Cu feeding, respectively.
