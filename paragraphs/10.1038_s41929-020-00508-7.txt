Methods Catalyst preparation. Commercial ceria (MEL) was calcined at 700 °C for 5 h to reduce the number of defect sites and trigger the formation of {111} facets (Supplementary Table 5). Robot-controlled incipient wetness impregnation was performed using an Accelerator SLT106 Parallel Synthesizer (SLT CATIMPREG, ChemSpeed Technologies)58. First, 1 g ceria was placed in a batch reactor, then 0.16 ml of a 25.8 × 10−3 M tetraammineplatinum(II) nitrate (99.995%, Sigma-Aldrich) aqueous solution was added and dried under reduced pressure for 20 min at 70 °C. This step was repeated, until the desired weight loading of Pt was achieved. The Pt/CeO 2 catalyst, denoted as Pt-single site (Pt-SS), was first calcined at 500 °C for 5 h and then hydrothermally (10% O2 and 10% H2O in N2) treated at 800 °C for 16 h. The catalyst was cooled in steam to ~200 °C, and then in 10% O2/N2 to room temperature. For comparison, the same catalyst was subsequently reduced in 2% H2 for 30 min at 400 °C to generate reduced Pt nanoparticles (Pt-NP). For the catalytic tests and X-ray-based characterization, Pt-NP was prepared in situ directly before the measurements
