Ir–GO–NH 2 -x synthesis. First, to prepare the nitrogen-doped graphene support (GO–NH 2 ), GO (purchased from CYG and used as received) was mixed with urea (VWR) with a mass ratio of 1 to 10, and further heated in a tube furnace to 500 °C under a gas flow of 100 sccm Ar (UHP, Airgas) within 1 h, and then kept at the same temperature for another 2 h before cooling to room temperature. Then, Ir– GO–NH 2 -x was synthesized by following the same process as for Ir–N–C-x catalyst using the GO–NH 2 as the support instead of GQDs–NH 2 .

Ni–N–C-x synthesis. First, 1 gram of Ni(NO 3 ) 2 ∙6H 2 O (Sigma) was dissolved into 200 millilitres of DI water to prepare the Ni(NO 3 ) 2 stock solution with a concentration of ~5 milligrams per millilitre. Then, for the Ni–N–C sample with 15 wt% nickel, 3 millilitres of Ni(NO 3 ) 2 stock solution was added to ~30 millilitres of purified GQDs–NH 2 solution (~30 milligrams of GQDs–NH 2 ), followed by sonication in ice water for 15 min. The above solution was freeze dried and mixed with urea (VWR) with a mass ratio of 1 to 10 and further heated in a tube furnace to 750 °C under a gas flow of 100 sccm Ar (UHP, Airgas) within 1 h, and then kept at the same temperature for another 1 h before cooling to room temperature. Finally, the as-prepared powder was collected for further characterization. To synthesize the Ni–N–C-x catalysts for the electrochemical CO 2 reduction test, only 30 milligrams of GQDs–NH 2 was replaced using 30 milligrams of GQDs–OH. To prepare GQDs– OH, all the processes are the same as in the preparation of GQDs–NH 2 except 240 millilitres of 0.2 M NaOH solution was used to replace the previous ammonia solution (220 millilitres of DI plus 20 millilitres of concentrated ammonia). This is because the heavily nitrogen-doped carbon matrix will also promote the hydrogen evolution reaction. The as-prepared Ni–N–C-1.5 (~7.5 wt% Ni) and Ni–N–C-3 (~15 wt% Ni) single-atom catalysts from GQDs–OH were also verified using STEM.

Synthesis of functionalized GQDs. A modified molecular fusion route was employed to synthesize well-crystallized GQDs– NH 2 (Methods)34. Photoluminescence (PL) emission studies (Supplementary Fig. 1) of the as-prepared carbon suspension pres- ents an excitation-dependent PL, confirming the successful prepa- ration of GQDs33.

Synthesis of Ir single-atom catalyst. We then use the as-obtained GQDs–NH 2 solution to synthesize the Ir–N–C catalyst with var- ied iridium loadings (Fig. 2a). Specifically, different volumes of IrCl 3 stock solution (5 milligrams per millilitre) were first added into 30 millilitres of GQDs–NH 2 solution (1 milligram per mil- lilitre), henceforth referred to as Ir–N–C-x where x represents the IrCl 3 volume in millilitres, followed by freeze drying and pyrolysis.

Methods GQDs–NH 2 synthesis. A modified molecular fusion route was employed to synthesize well-crystallized GQDs–NH 2 34 . Typically, 8 grams of pyrene (Sigma, purity >98%) was nitrated into trinitropyrene in 640 millilitres of concentrated HNO 3 (70%, Sigma) at 80 °C under refluxing and stirring for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was washed to neutral pH using deionized (DI) water (18.2 MΩ) by centrifuging. The resultant yellow 1,3,6-trinitropyrene was then dried under vacuum at room temperature. Next, 1.2 grams of dried 1,3,6-trinitropyrene powder were dispersed into a solution containing 220 millilitres of DI water and 20 millilitres of concentrated ammonia solution (30%, Sigma). The above mixture was ultrasonicated in ice water using a batch sonicator for 4 h. Sixty millilitres of the homogeneous suspension were transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave (100 millilitres). The four autoclaves (total 240 millilitres mixture solution) were heated at 200 °C for 10 h. After natural cooling to room temperature, all the product-containing solution was filtered through a 0.22 μm microporous membrane to remove insoluble carbon product and further concentrated to ~90 millilitres by rotation drying. The concentrated solution was dialysed in a dialysis bag (retained molecular weight, ~12–14 kDa, Innovating Science) for two days to remove contamination and unfused small molecules. The concentration of purified GQDs–NH 2 solution was ~1 milligram per millilitre.

Ir–N–C-x synthesis. First, 1 gram of IrCl 3 ∙xH 2 O (Alfa Aesar) was dissolved into 200 millilitres of DI water to prepare the IrCl 3 stock solution with a concentration of ~5 milligrams per millilitre. For the Ir–N–C-7 sample, 7 millilitres of IrCl 3 stock solution were added to ~30 millilitres of purified GQDs–NH 2 solution (~30 milligrams of GQDs–NH 2 ). Then, the mixture solution was sonicated in ice water for 15 min, followed by being quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. After freeze drying, the as-prepared aerogel-like powder was mixed with urea (VWR) with a mass ratio of 1 to 10 and further heated in a tube furnace to 500 °C under a gas flow of 100 sccm Ar (UHP, Airgas) within 1 h, and kept at the same temperature for another 2 h before cooling to room temperature. Finally, the Ir–N–C-7 powder was collected for further characterizations. For other Ir–N–C-x catalyst syntheses, only the volume of IrCl 3 stock solution was changed; for example 1 millilitre of IrCl 3 stock solution was used to prepared Ir–N–C-1 catalyst. The nominal Ir loading was defined using following equation: Mass added − Ir ( mg ) Mass added − Ir ( mg )+ Mass GQDs ( mg ) × 100 %, where Mass added–Ir and Mass GQDs are the masses of the added Ir and the GQDs, respectively.

Pt–N–C-6 synthesis. First, 1 gram of H 2 PtCl 6 (Sigma) was dissolved into 200 millilitres of DI water to prepare the H 2 PtCl 6 stock solution with a concentration of 5 milligrams per millilitre. Then, 6 millilitres of H 2 PtCl 6 stock solution was added to ~30 millilitres of purified GQDs–NH 2 solution (~30 milligrams of GQDs–NH 2 ), followed by sonication in ice water for 15 min. The above solution was freeze dried and mixed with urea (VWR) with a mass ratio of 1 to 10, and further heated in a tube furnace to 500 °C under a gas flow of 100 sccm Ar (UHP, Airgas) within 2 h, and then kept at the same temperature for another 1 h before cooling to room temperature. Finally, the Pt–N–C-6 powder was collected for further characterization. The nominal Pt loading was defined using the following equation: Mass added − Pt ( mg ) Mass added − Pt ( mg )+ Mass GQDs ( mg ) × 100 %, where Mass added–Pt is the mass of the added Pt.
