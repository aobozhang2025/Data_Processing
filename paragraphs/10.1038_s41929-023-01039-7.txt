Methods Catalyst synthesis Fe 0.5 NC catalyst was prepared from Fe II acetate (98%, Sigma-Aldrich), 1,10-phenanthroline (phen; ≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and Zn II zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8, Basolite Z1200, BASF). One gram of the precursor mixture containing 0.5 wt% Fe and a mass ratio of phen/ZIF-8 of 20/80 were mixed using dry ball-milling for four cycles of 30 min at 400 rpm. A ZrO 2 crucible with 100 ZrO 2 balls of 5 mm diameter was used in this procedure. The resulting precursors were pyrolysed at 1,323 K under Ar flow for 1 h. Fe 0.5 NC contained Fe content of ca. 1.5 wt%, as con- firmed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP–OES). For the synthesis of Fe 0.5 NC–Pt, 0.5 wt% Pt was impregnated on Fe 0.5 NC by conventional wet impregnation and subsequent H 2 reduc- tion. 0.1 g Fe 0.5 NC was dissolved and dispersed in 100 ml of de-ionized water containing 1.3 mg of H 2 PtCl 6 ·6H 2 O (≥37.5%, Pt basis, Merck), and then the solvent was evaporated at 353 K. The resultant powder sample was dried at 353 K under vacuum overnight and reduced at 523 K for 3 h under H 2 flow (5%, 200 ml min −1 ). Commercial Pt nanoparticle (HiSPEC 3000, 20 wt% Pt) was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. For the synthesis of Fe 2 O 3 /NC, the NC catalyst was first prepared identically to Fe 0.5 NC, except for the addition of Fe II acetate during the ball-milling step. Note that owing to the presence of trace amounts of Fe impurities in the commercial ZIF-8 (>100 ppm) (ref. 39), Fe-free ZIF-8 was used for the synthesis of NC, which was prepared by mixing 2-methylimidazole (2-MeIm; 99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and Zn nitrate hexahydrate (Zn salt; 98%, Sigma-Aldrich) in aqueous solution (Zn salt/2-MeIm/water molar ratio of 1/60/2228) (ref. 40). Afterwards, Fe 2 O 3 /NC was synthesized by a dry ball-milling of 98 mg NC and 2 mg commercial Fe 2 O 3 (96%, Sigma-Aldrich) for four cycles of 30 min at 400 rpm without heat treatment. The Fe content in Fe 2 O 3 /NC was ca. 1.3 wt%, as confirmed by ICP–OES. Commercial Fe–N–C catalyst (no. PMF-0110904, Pajarito Powder) was purchased from Pajarito Powder Inc, which is synthe- sized via hard templating with fumed silica. The carbon nanotube (CNT)-supported Fe-N-C catalyst (FeNC/CNT) was synthesized using a silica-protective-layer-assisted approach 41 . Then 100 mg of nitric acid-treated CNTs (Carbon Nanomaterial Technology) were mixed with 200 mg of Fe III TMPPCl (Porphyrin Systems) in an agate mortar for 5 min. The mixture was heated in a quartz-tube furnace, starting from room temperature to 673 K, at a ramping rate of 275 K min−1 and kept at that temperature for 3 h under N2 gas (99.999%) flowing at a rate of 1 l min−1. Afterwards, the heat-treated CNT/FeIIITMPPCl composite was mixed with 0.5 ml of TEOS in a mortar, followed by mixing with 0.5 ml of formic acid. The resulting mixture was transferred to an alumina crucible and dried in a 333 K oven for 3 h. Subsequently, the composite was heated to 1,073 K at a ramping rate of 275 K min−1 and maintained at that temperature for 3 h under N2 gas flowing at a rate of 1 l min−1. To etch the silica, the resulting composite was mixed with 2:1 (v/v) solution of ethanol and 10% aqueous HF, and stirred for 30 min. The mixture was then filtered and washed with ethanol multiple times. The HF etching process was repeated following the same procedure, and the resulting sample was dried at 333 K to obtain FeNC/CNT samples.
