Methods Catalyst synthesis. During the synthesis, an Fe–N–C catalyst with a high FeN 4 active site density was prepared via pyrolysis of an Fe 2 O 3 @ZIF-8 composite precursor consisting of ultra-fine Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles encapsulated in ZIF-8 nanocrystals. In a typical procedure to synthesize Fe 2 O 3 @ZIF-8 composite precursors, Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles (Alfa-Aesar) with a size of ~5 nm (10 mg) and zinc nitrate hexahydrate (6.78 g) were dispersed and dissolved into a methanol solution (150 ml). The other methanol solution (150 ml) containing 2-methylimidazole (7.92 g) was prepared. Then both solutions were mixed and heated at 60 °C for 24 h. The resulting precipitant was collected and washed with ethanol, then dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven to obtain Fe 2 O 3 @ZIF-8 composite precursor. In the first step to synthesize Fe–N–C catalysts, the composite precursors were subjected to a heating treatment at 800 °C for 30 min under flowing Ar gas to obtain a sample denoted as Fe–N–C-800. We found that Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles can gradually release Fe contents during thermal activation, which are captured by surrounding defected nitrogen ligands from ZIF-8s, increasing atomically dispersed FeN 4 site density9, superior to the typically used Fe3+ ion precursors such as FeCl 3 and Fe(NO 3 ) 3 . Then the Fe–N–C-800 (100 mg) were ground with NH 4 Cl salts (300 mg) thoroughly, followed by a heating treatment at 1,100 °C (taking 30 mins to rapidly increase the temperature to 1,100 °C) under Ar flow for 1 h to obtain the first catalyst, denoted as Fe–AC (AC: ammonia chloride) catalyst. NH 4 Cl decomposes to NH 3 and HCl gas at high temperatures, which produce substantial internal stress and etch the carbon, thus creating a multitude of micropores and carbon defects45, similar to previously reported Fe–N–C catalysts with NH 3 gas treatments6,46.
