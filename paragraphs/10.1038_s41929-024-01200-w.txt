Methods Catalyst synthesis The Ru-CuNW catalyst was synthesized on the basis of our previ- ously published method 47 with slight modification. In brief, a 2 cm 2 Cu foam was washed with isopropyl alcohol, 0.1 M HCl, and then soaked in 0.1 M (NH 4 ) 2 S 2 O 8 with 1 M NaOH under ambient conditions for 1 h. The synthesized Cu(OH) 2 was then washed with deionized water and soaked in 10 mM RuCl 3 solution under ambient conditions overnight. Next, the product was dried at 70 °C in an oven for 1 h and then annealed in a flowing Ar atmosphere at 200 °C for 2 h. Finally, an in situ electrochemical pre-reduction step was performed, which was operated by the CP method at 100 mA cm −2 overnight, followed by 200 mA cm −2 for 1 h to obtain the final Ru-CuNW catalyst. This catalyst was directly used as the cathode electrode for later electrochemical measurements.
