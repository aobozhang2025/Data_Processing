Methods Preparation of Co 1 CNCl/S and other Co-based SACs NaCl (3 g), glucose (300 mg), CoSO 4 ·7H 2 O (28.1 mg) and dicyandi- amide (332 mg) were dissolved in 30 ml of deionized water and stirred continuously for 2 h. The resulting solution was freeze dried under vacuum to yield a powder, which was then ground in a mortar and pyrolysed at 900 °C for 2 h under an argon atmosphere, with a heating rate of 5 °C min −1 . After cooling to room temperature, the black powder was subjected to acid etching with 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 to remove unstable Co species and NaCl. The obtained black powder was dried at 60 °C, and the sample was designated as Co 1 CNCl/S. Carbon samples were also synthesized similarly without CoSO 4 ·7H 2 O. Other Co SACs were prepared using different precursors of Co salts. CN/S was obtained using the same mole amount of Na 2 SO 4 without Co salts. C/S was syn- thesized without Co salts and dicyandiamide but with Na 2 SO 4 . Co 1 CN and Co 1 CN/S were prepared by pyrolysis of a mixture of CoPc and CN or CN/S (Co content is approximately 2 wt.%), respectively, at 450 °C under flowing argon for 1 h.

Results Synthesis and morphology of Co-SACs The synthesis procedure of Co 1 CNCl/S is shown in Fig. 1a. First, CoSO 4 , dicyandiamide, glucose and sodium chloride (NaCl) were dissolved in water and then freeze dried to encapsulate Co ions and other mol- ecules within NaCl crystal lattice. Afterwards, the resulting mixture was annealed at 900 °C in an argon atmosphere, leading to the carboniza- tion of glucose to form a graphene network between the salt lattice to obtain a three-dimensional (3D) Co-SAC nanosheets–NaCl mixture.
