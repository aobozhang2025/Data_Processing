Methods Synthesis of M 1 /MoS 2 catalysts A series of M 1 /MoS 2 SASCs were prepared according to the designed synthetic protocol as follows. First, 1 mmol Mo source (176 mg, (NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 ·4H 2 O), a certain amount of metal salts (Mn(CH 3 COO) 2 ·4H 2 O, Fe(CH 3 COO) 2 ·4H 2 O, Co(CH 3 COO) 2 ·4H 2 O and Ni(CH 3 COO) 2 ·4H 2 O) and 750 mg CH 3 CSNH 2 (10.0 mmol) were dissolved in 70 ml distilled water. The solution containing precursors was then transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave (100 ml). Subsequently, it was sealed and maintained at 180 °C for 20 h and then naturally cooled to room temperature. The resulting product was washed with distilled water and absolute ethanol several times, and dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h. Under an Ar flow of 100 sccm, the dried product was heated to 400 °C at a rate of 10 °C min −1 and kept there for 2 hours in a furnace, and then cooled to room temperature. A series of M 1 /MoS 2 SASCs can be obtained using this approach by tuning the contents and types of metal salt precursors (n M /n Mo max = 20 at.%).
