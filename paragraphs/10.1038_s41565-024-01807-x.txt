Synthesis of Ir 1 /(Co,Fe)-OH/MI Ir 1 /(Co,Fe)-OH/MI was synthesized using a straightforward immer- sion technique conducted at ambient temperature and pressure. A solution was prepared by dissolving cobalt nitrate (Co(NO 3 ) 2 ∙6H 2 O, 1 mmol), iron nitrate (Fe(NO 3 ) 3 ∙6H 2 O, 1 mmol) and an Ir 3+ aqueous solution (7.14 mg ml −1 , 350 µl) in a mixture of deionized water (20 ml) and ethylene glycol (10 ml). The pH value of this solution was kept at ~4.5 by adding an appropriate amount of 2 mol l −1 NaOH. Subsequently, the pre-prepared Co-MI electrode was immersed in this solution for 20 h. Following immersion, the Ir 1 /(Co,Fe)-OH/MI was obtained and washed three times using deionized water. The mass loading of the Ir 1 /(Co,Fe)-OH/MI catalyst loaded on Ni foam was 0.70 mg cm −2 . For comparative purposes, Ir 1 /(Co,Fe)-OH, a material without MI, was synthesized. This was achieved through a simple electrodeposition method using an aqueous solution of Co 2+ /Fe 3+ /Ir 3+ . During this process, an electrodeposition potential of −1 V (versus a saturated calomel refer- ence electrode) was maintained, and the electrodeposition time was set at 240 s. In addition, samples without Ir atoms, specifically (Co,Fe)-OH/ MI and (Co,Fe)-OH, were synthesized using the above two methods. The active material average mass loadings of the (Co,Fe)-OH/MI, Ir 1 / (Co,Fe)-OH and (Co,Fe)-OH electrodes were recorded as 0.70 mg cm −2 , 0.71 mg cm −2 and 0.73 mg cm −2 , respectively. The impact of Ni foam thickness, Co/Fe ratio and Ir species’ mass fractions on the OER per- formance of Ir 1 /(Co,Fe)-OH/MI were investigated for optimization purposes (see Supplementary Figs. 56 and 57).
