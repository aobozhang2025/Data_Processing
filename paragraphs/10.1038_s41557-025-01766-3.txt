Methods Synthesis of the Cu 1 /TiO 2 SAC Before Cu loading, TiO 2 powder was reduced by 10% H 2 /N 2 at 500 °C for 2 h to obtain reduced TiO 2 (TiO 2 -reduced). The Cu 1 /TiO 2 SAC was prepared using a modified photodeposition method, where the pho- todeposition process was performed by a high-power light-emitting diode (LED) lamp with a wavelength of 385 nm (Beijing Perfectlight, PL-LED100C). Typically, 200 mg of pretreated TiO 2 powder was dis- persed into 20 ml of ultrapure water, then 760 μl of Cu(NO 3 ) 2 ·3H 2 O (20 mg ml −1 ) aqueous solution was introduced into the mixture under vigorously stirring in a 100-ml beaker. The obtained suspension was then subject to UV illumination for 5 min at ambient temperature, with the operating current set to 0.8 A. Subsequently, the mixture was centrifuged and washed in ultrapure water twice, then dried overnight at 60 °C in an oven. The bulk sample was milled carefully using a quartz mortar to obtain fresh Cu 1 /TiO 2 SAC (Cu 1 /TiO 2 -fresh). The M/TiO 2 (M represents Ni, Fe, Co, Zn) and Cu-based catalysts were prepared by following the same procedures as Cu 1 /TiO 2 SAC.

Synthesis of the Cu/TiO 2 nanoparticle catalyst (Cu NP /TiO 2 ) Copper nanoparticles with an average diameter of 2 nm were fabri- cated using a modified solution chemistry. Typically, quantities of Cu(NO 3 ) 2 ·3H 2 O and l-ascorbic acid were dissolved in 10 ml of water, respectively, to obtain solution A (2 mmol Cu(NO 3 ) 2 ·3H 2 O aqueous solu- tion) and solution B (6 mmol l-ascorbic acid aqueous solution). Solution A was then transferred into a flask and heated to 80 °C in an oil bath, fol- lowed by dropwise addition of solution B into solution A with magnetic stirring. The mixture was maintained at 80 °C to ensure that all Cu ions in the solution were reduced quickly. Thirty minutes later, the heating was terminated, and the obtained colloid solution was used as the source of Cu nanoparticles (denoted solution C). Cu NP /TiO 2 was prepared by the incipient-wetness impregnation method. In a typical Cu NP /TiO 2 synthesis, 60 μl of solution C and 240 μl of water were simultane- ously added into 400 mg of the reduced TiO 2 powder with 10% H 2 /N 2 at 500 °C. After thorough mixing, the slurry was dried, milled, and calcined at 300 °C for 2 h to remove the redundant reactants.

Synthesis of the Cu/TiO 2 nanocluster catalyst (Cu cluster /TiO 2 ) The Cu nanoclusters were provided by C. Liu 42 . To synthesize Cu cluster / TiO 2 , 1 mg of Cu nanoclusters were dispersed in 0.5 ml of CH 2 Cl 2 , then further diluted in 5 ml of CH 3 OH. Subsequently, 200 mg of the afore- mentioned reduced TiO 2 powder was added. Following careful stirring, the mixture was dried overnight in an oven at 60 °C. The bulk sample was milled carefully using a quartz mortar to obtain Cu cluster /TiO 2 .
