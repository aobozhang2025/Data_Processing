Synthesis of Co-TiO 2 , Ni-TiO 2 , Fe-TiO 2 , Cu-TiO 2 , Mn-TiO 2 and TiO 2 nanorods. The TiO 2 and Co-TiO 2 nanorods were synthesized by an organic colloidal solution approach based on our previous publication33. As TiCl 4 is highly sensitive to moisture, all the solvents employed in the synthesis were pre-dried at 90 °C in a vacuum using a typical Schlenk link technique. For the synthesis of the TiO 2 nanorods, a Ti precursor solution containing 0.2 M TiCl 4 and 1.0 M OAc was first prepared by dissolving TiCl 4 (2.19 ml) and OAc (31.59 ml) in ODE (66.25 ml) and stored in a N 2 -filled glove box. In a four-necked reactor, ODE (10 ml), OAm (10 ml) and OAc (0.48 ml) were heated under vacuum at 90 °C for 1 hour to remove dissolved moisture and oxygen, and subsequently cooled to 60 °C under N 2 . Next, 1.5 ml of Ti precursor solution was injected into the system, which was then quickly heated to 290 °C and maintained at that temperature for 10 min. Next, 8 ml of additional Ti precursor solution was added into the reactor at a rate of 0.3 ml min−1. After cooling to room temperature, the TiO 2 nanorods were collected, washed with isopropanol and centrifuged at 8,000 r.p.m. for 8 min. The product was further purified twice by the addition of hexanes and isopropanol. The Co-TiO 2 nanorods were synthesized by a similar route. A Co oleate solution containing 0.2 M cobalt oleate and 1.0 M OAc was mixed with the Ti precursor solution with the desired Ti/Co ratio. Next, 1.5 ml of this solution was injected into a degassed solution containing 10 ml of ODE, 10 ml of OAm and 0.48 ml of OAc at 60 °C, and the mixture was quickly heated to 290 °C. After being held at that temperature for 10 min, another 8 ml of the mixed Ti/Co precursor solution was introduced into the system at 0.3 ml min−1. The as-prepared Co-TiO 2 nanorods were collected and purified in the same way as for the TiO 2 nanorods. In this synthesis, the Co doping level was tuned by altering the Ti/Co ratio in the mixed precursor solution. Specifically, with Ti/Co molar ratios of 8:1, 8:2 and 8:3, Co doping levels of 4.2, 7.5 and 12% were achieved in the Co-TiO 2 nanorods. The Ni-TiO 2 , Fe-TiO 2 , Cu-TiO 2 and Mn-TiO 2 nanorods were synthesized by the same approach, using the corresponding metal oleate to substitute for Co oleate33. The synthesis of CoO nanoparticles is described in the Supplementary Methods.
