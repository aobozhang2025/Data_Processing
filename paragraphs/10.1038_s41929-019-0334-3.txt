Methods Catalyst preparation. Supported Pt catalysts with different Pt loadings (0.05, 0.08, 0.2 and 0.5 wt%) were synthesized using the wet-impregnation method. The dried materials were then heat treated in a number of ways and tested for the chemoselective hydrogenation of 3-NS. For a typical catalyst preparation (2 g), the requisite amount of aqueous hydrogen hexachloroplatinic acid solution (9.6 mg Pt ml–1, assay 30.21% H2PtCl6, Johnson Matthey) was diluted to 16 ml using deionized water, and heated in an oil bath to 60 °C with vigorous stirring (800 r.p.m.) before the addition of the requisite amount of support (TiO2, Evonik P25). The temperature was subsequently increased to 95 °C for 16 h to dry the slurry in air. The resultant material was then ground thoroughly (referred to as the ‘fresh dried-only’ sample). A portion (500 mg) of the dried-only sample was either calcined in static air or reduced under a steady flow of 5% H2/Ar. Heat treatments were carried out at 450 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. All of these materials were tested as catalysts without any further treatment unless stated otherwise.
