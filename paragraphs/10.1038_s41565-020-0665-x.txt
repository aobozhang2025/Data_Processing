Synthesis and characterization of the SA-Rh/CN catalyst SA-Rh/CN was synthesized via a host–guest strategy. Figure 1a presents a schematic to demonstrate the preparation of SA-Rh/CN. Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks with molecular-scale cages (ZIF-8) were employed to disperse and immobilize Rh(acac) 3 , because the dimensions of Rh(acac) 3 (9.36 Å) are between the size of the large cav- ities (diameter of 11.6 Å) and the size of the small pores (diameter of 3.4 Å) of ZIF-8. The Rh(acac) 3 can thus be trapped within the molec- ular cages of the ZIF-8 (denoted Rh/ZIF-8). During pyrolysis, Rh/ ZIF-8 is reduced in situ to form SA-Rh/CN (for details see Methods). Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns reveal no differences between the ZIF-8 and Rh/ZIF-8, suggesting the homogeneous dis- tribution of Rh(acac) 3 in ZIF-8 (Supplementary Fig. 1), while the PXRD patterns and Raman spectra reveal the nature of defective amorphous carbon in SA-Rh/CN (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3).

Synthesis. Typical preparation of Rh/ZIF-8 and Pd/ZIF-8. Rh(acac) 3 (144 mg) and Zn(NO 3 ) 2 (1.19 g) were dissolved in 15 ml methanol (denoted solution A). 2-Methylimidazole (1.31 g) was dissolved in 30 ml methanol (denoted solution B). Solutions A and B were each stirred for 5 min. Both solutions were poured into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (volume, 50 ml). After heating at 120 °C for 4 h, the sealed autoclave was cooled to room temperature. The product (yellowish powder) was collected by centrifugation and washed with DMF and methanol three times each. The same procedure was utilized for the synthesis of Pd/ZIF-8 and Pt/ZIF-8 by using Pd(acac) 2 (80 mg) and Pt(acac) 2 (60 mg), respectively, instead of Rh(acac) 3 .

Typical preparation of SA-Rh/CN (3 h), Rh/CN-2h, Rh/CN-4h, Rh/CN-5h, Rh/ CN-1100 SA-Pd/CN and SA-Pt/CN. Rh/ZIF-8 (1 g) was added to a crucible. The crucible was then placed in a tube-type furnace and heated to 900 °C for 2–5 h (1,100 °C for 6 h to prepare Rh/CN-1100) at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 under a N 2 atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, SA-Rh/CN (black powder) was obtained. The product could be used directly without further treatment. The same procedure was utilized for the synthesis of SA-Pd/CN and SA-Pt/CN by using Pd/ZIF-8 (1 g) and Pt/ZIF-8 (1 g), respectively, instead of Rh/ZIF-8 (1 g).

Typical preparation of Rh/C. RhCl 3 ·3H 2 O (50 mg) was added to 10 ml deionized water under vigorous stirring at room temperature. NaBH 4 (72 mg) in 10 ml deionized water was added dropwise to RhCl 3 solution. After 5 min, black nanocrystals were collected by centrifugation. Rh nanoparticles were washed with ethanol three times and dried at 70 °C. Vulcan XC-72 (100 mg) was added into 100 ml ethanol. Under vigorous stirring, 20 mg prepared Rh nanoparticles were added to the suspension at room temperature then stirred continuously for 4 h. The catalyst was collected by centrifugation. Rh/C was dried at 70 °C for 12 h to remove the solvent, then the solid was used for electrochemical measurements without further purification.
