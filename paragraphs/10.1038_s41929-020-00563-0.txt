Preparation of PdCl 2 /UiO-66-NH 2 @Fe-TiPP and yolk–shells Pd 1 @Fe, Fe 1 @ Pd 1 , Pd 1 @CN and CN@Fe 1 . First, α,α′-dibromo-p-xylene (18 mg) was dissolved in 20 ml of DMF to form a clear solution, which was subsequently added into 40 ml of DMF that contained the as-prepared Fe-TiPP (10 mg), TiPP (20 mg) and PdCl 2 /UiO-66-NH 2 @SiO 2 (60 mg) under robust stirring at room temperature. The mixed suspension was then transferred into a 100 ml round-bottomed flask kept at 110 °C for 24 h. The obtained product was separated by centrifugation and washed subsequently with DMF three times and ethanol twice, and finally dried at 70 °C under vacuum overnight. Next, the collected solid powder (core–shell–shell PdCl 2 / UiO-66-NH 2 @Fe-TiPP) was placed in a tube furnace and heated to 700 °C for 3 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 under flowing N 2 gas and then naturally cooled to room temperature to obtain the representative samples. The obtained samples were etched in a 1 M NaOH aqueous solution at room temperature for 24 h to remove the SiO 2 template to give the final yolk–shell Pd 1 @Fe 1 catalyst. The same procedure was utilized for the synthesis of yolk–shell Fe 1 @Pd 1 via reversing the order of addition of Pd and Fe. The PdCl 2 /UiO-66-NH 2 @SiO 2 @TiPP was prepared by coating the pure TiPP polymer, followed by heat treatment and removal of the SiO 2 template to generate yolk–shell Pd 1 @CN. The UiO-66-NH 2 @SiO 2 @Fe-TiPP was utilized for the synthesis of yolk–shell CN@Fe 1 via heat treatment and removal of the SiO 2 template. The core–shell Pd 1 @Fe 1 catalyst was directly prepared by the pyrolysis of PdCl 2 /UiO-66-NH 2 @Fe-TiPP.

Preparation of PdCl 2 /UiO-66-NH 2 . The Pd precursor (PdCl 2 ) was adsorbed through unsaturated dangling –NH 2 groups by wet impregnation. Briefly, a mixed precursor of ZrCl 4 (315 mg) and PdCl 2 /H 2 BDC-NH 2 (5.6 mg/245 mg) was dissolved in 300 ml of DMF that contained 36 ml of glacial acetic acid in a 500 ml round-bottomed flask. The mixture was treated with ultrasound for 0.5 h to form a homogeneous transparent solution. Then, the mixture was heated at 120 °C for 3 h and then cooled to room temperature. The as-obtained products were centrifuged at 7,000 r.p.m. for 3 min and washed with methanol and DMF (1/4 v/v) three times. Finally, the as-prepared PdCl 2 /UiO-66-NH 2 was dried in vacuum at 65 °C overnight.

Preparation of hollow Pd 1 &Fe 1 . To synthesize hollow Pd 1 &Fe 1 , the SiO 2 spheres was first prepared via the classical Stöber method. Absolute ethanol (300 ml), deionized water (100 ml) and 28% NH 3 ·H 2 O (15 ml) were mixed and stirred. A total of 12 ml of TEOS was quickly added to the mixture. After a reaction time of about 60 min, the silica spheres were isolated by centrifugation. Then, α,α′-dibromo-p-xylene (40 mg) was dissolved in 20 ml of DMF to form a clear solution, which was subsequently added to 20 ml of DMF that contained the as-prepared Fe-TiPP (14 mg), Pd-TiPP (14 mg) and SiO 2 (40 mg) under robust stirring at room temperature. The mixed suspension was then transferred into a 100 ml round-bottomed flask and kept at 110 °C for 24 h. The obtained product was separated by centrifugation and washed subsequently with DMF three times and ethanol twice, and finally dried at 70 °C under vacuum overnight. Finally, the collected solid powder was placed in a tube furnace and heated to 700 °C for 3 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 under flowing N 2 gas and then naturally cooled to room temperature. Then, the obtained samples were etched in a 1 M NaOH aqueous solution at room temperature for 24 h to remove the SiO 2 spheres to obtain the hollow Pd 1 &Fe 1 catalyst.

Preparation of hollow Pd 1 @Fe 1 . For the synthesis of the hollow Pd 1 @Fe 1 catalyst, α,α′-dibromo-p-xylene (40 mg) was dissolved in 20 ml of DMF to form a clear solution, which was subsequently added to 20 ml of DMF that contained the as-prepared TiPP (14 mg), Pd-TiPP (14 mg) and SiO 2 (40 mg) under robust stirring at room temperature. The mixed suspension was then transferred into a 100 ml round-bottomed flask at 110 °C for 24 h. The obtained SiO 2 @Pd-TiPP was separated by centrifugation and washed subsequently with DMF three times and ethanol twice, and finally dried at 70 °C under vacuum overnight. Then, the as-prepared SiO 2 @Pd-TiPP (60 ml, 1 mg ml−1) was dissolved in a mixed solution that contained ethyl alcohol (6 ml), cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (160 mg) and NaOH solution (0.5 ml) under ultrasonication for 0.5 h. Then, TEOS (0.4 ml) was added to this suspension and stirred for 2 h at 60 °C. The three-layer core– shell–shell SiO 2 @Pd-TiPP@SiO 2 was collected and washed three times with ethyl alcohol, after which the core–shell–shell SiO 2 @Pd-TiPP@SiO 2 (50 mg) was further dissolved in 20 ml of DMF that contained TiPP (20 mg) and Fe-TiPP (20 mg) to form a homogeneous solution. Then, α,α′-dibromo-p-xylene (60 ml, 1 mg ml−1) was added to the above suspension and stirred for 24 h at 110 °C. Finally, the collected solid powder was placed in a tube furnace and heated to 700 °C for 3 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 under flowing N 2 gas and then naturally cooled to room temperature. Then obtained samples were etched in 1 M NaOH aqueous solution at room temperature for 24 h to remove the SiO 2 template to obtain the hollow Pd 1 @Fe 1 catalyst.

Preparation of UiO-66-NH 2 . In a typical procedure, a mixture of ZrCl 4 (315 mg) and H 2 BDC-NH 2 (245 mg) was dissolved in 300 ml of DMF that contained 40 ml of glacial acetic acid into a 500 ml round-bottomed flask. The mixture was treated with ultrasound for 0.5 h to form a homogeneous transparent solution. Then, the mixture was heated at 120 °C for 3 h and cooled to room temperature. The as-obtained products were centrifuged at 7,000 r.p.m. for 3 min and washed with methanol and DMF (1/4 v/v) three times. Finally, the as-prepared UiO-66-NH 2 was dried under vacuum at 65 °C for further use.
