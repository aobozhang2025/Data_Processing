Preparation of Pt@BT-O, Pt@BT and Pt@TiO 2 . Pt was introduced via a wet impregnation of substrates (50 mg) with a certain concentration of H 2 PtCl 6 aqueous solution (0.1 ml), followed by the calcination at 513 K for 2 h in vacuum (< 0.1 Pa). The prepared catalyst was stored in vacuum.

Catalyst preparation Preparation of BT. The BT was produced via a facile solid-state treat- ment of Degussa P25 TiO 2 with NaBH 4 (ref. 34 ). In detail, a mixture of 1.0 g of Degussa P25 TiO 2 and 2.0 g of NaBH 4 was ground thoroughly for 0.5 h. The mixture was then heated in a tube furnace at 623 K for 1 h in a vacuum (< 2.0 Pa), followed by natural cooling to room temperature. The black powders obtained after the treatment were washed 6–8 times with deionized water and then dried in a vacuum oven. The BET surface area of the as-synthesized BT was measured to be 84.4 m 2 g −1 .

Preparation of Pt2+@BT-O. Pt was introduced via a conventional wet impregnation of substrates (50 mg) with a certain concentration of (Pt(NH 3 ) 4 )(NO 3 ) 2 aqueous solution (0.1 ml), followed by the calcina- tion at 513 K for 2 h in a vacuum (<0.1 Pa). The prepared catalyst was stored in vacuum.

Preparation of BT-O. The as-synthesized BT (50 mg) was dispersed in the aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide (5 M, 10 ml) and stirred for 1 h at 298 K. The suspension was filtered to obtain a precipitate, which was washed with deionized water and then dried in a vacuum oven at 353 K. The BET surface area of the as-synthesized BT-O was measured to be 98.3 m 2 g −1 .

Preparation of Pt0 NPS @BT-O. The metallic Pt 0 -modified BT-O catalyst was obtained through the chemical-reducing H 2 PtCl 6 in a NaBH4 aque- ous solution. Specifically, 0.2 g of BT-O powders was added into 50 ml of aqueous solution of H 2 PtCl 6 , followed by stirring under darkness overnight. Then, 5 ml of NaBH 4 (0.2 M) and NaOH (0.05 M) solution was added dropwise with vigorous stirring at room temperature. After 1 h reduction, the material was washed with water and then dried in a vac- uum oven at 383 K for 5 h. The prepared catalyst was stored in vacuum. The synthetic conditions of all catalysts were summarized in Sup- plementary Table 8.
