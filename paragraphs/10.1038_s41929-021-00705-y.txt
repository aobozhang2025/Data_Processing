Synthesis of CoPc/CNT. CoPc/CNT was synthesized following an analogous protocol reported in the literature73. CoPc (1 mg) was mixed with 30 mg of a multiwall CNT in 30 ml dimethylformamide solution and stirred for 24 h. The suspension became transparent. The final suspension was washed using EtOH and H 2 O within a centrifuge to remove the dimethylformamide, and after that was freeze-dried to give the final catalyst.

Synthesis. The polyaniline-derived NiNC catalyst is identical to that reported in our previous studies71,72. Aniline (3 ml), NiCl 2 ·6H 2 O (5 g) and ammonium persulfate (5 g) were added to 0.5 l of 1 M HCl and stirred for 1 h. This suspension was then mixed with 0.4 g of a dispersed activated Ketjen 600 carbon black support (washed in HCl for purification and HNO 3 for oxygen doping), stirred for 48 h and then dried in the air at 95 °C for 24 h. The residual solid-state mixture was ball milled with Zr 2 O 3 balls for 20 min. We conducted the pyrolysis protocol in a furnace at 900 °C (ramp of 30 °C min–1) for 1 h under N 2 conditions, followed by acid washing steps (2 M H 2 SO 4 at 90 °C overnight) to remove the excessive Ni particles. We performed heat treatment four times and acid washing three times and the catalyst was obtained after the fourth pyrolysis.
