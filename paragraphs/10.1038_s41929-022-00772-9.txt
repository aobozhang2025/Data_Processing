Methods Synthesis of electrocatalysts. In the first step, commercial ZIF-8 (Basolite Z1200, Sigma Aldrich) as a combined C and N precursor was pyrolysed in a tube furnace at 900 °C for 1 h under flowing nitrogen gas (research grade, BOC Ltd) to obtain a nitrogen-doped carbon framework that contained abundant Zn–N x sites (Zn–NC). A heating rate of 3 K min−1 was used to reach the set temperature of 900 °C. The Zn–NC product was then leached by refluxing in a 2 M H 2 SO 4 solution (95% H 2 SO 4 , Aristar, VWR) for 15–18 h to effectively remove most of the coordinated Zn (□-NC), although these sites are protonated. Leaching Zn–NC under aggressive acid reflux conditions was significantly more effective to remove Zn as compared with acid leaching at room temperature. In the second step, 100 mg of □-NC powder was dispersed in 100 ml of methanol (VWR) that contained 100 mg of Fe(II)Cl 2 ·4H 2 O (99%, Honeywell Fluka). This corresponded to an approximately 22 wt% Fe(II) content in the Fe and □-NC mixture. For the scaled-up synthesis, 700 mg of □-NC was dispersed in 250 ml of methanol that contained 700 mg of Fe(II)Cl 2 ·4H 2 O. This mixture was refluxed for 15–18 h with constant stirring followed by thorough washing in de-ionized water and then overnight leaching in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 to ensure a complete removal of the physisorbed Fe ions. Afterwards, this iron-coordinated catalyst was subjected to a thorough aqueous washing and was then dried in a vacuum oven overnight at 70 °C. This unactivated catalyst, Fe–NCU, was then mixed with the DCDA (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) in a weight ratio of 2:1 and thoroughly ground for 15 min before it was subjected to the activation step at 900 °C for 1 h under a flow of a 5% H 2 /N 2 gas mixture (BOC Ltd). The temperature ramping rate was 3 K min−1 and the sample was cooled down naturally to room temperature after activation to give final activated catalyst, Fe–NCΔ-DCDA. For single-cell PEMFC tests, □-NC was additionally ball-milled to prepare the Fe–NCΔ-DCDA catalyst. The ball-milling of the dried □-NC powder was carried out at 400 r.p.m. for 2 h prior to the Fe incorporation step by methanol reflux. A control sample, Fe-NCΔ, was prepared by heat treating the Fe–NC under identical conditions, except that no DCDA was added. The Fe–NCΔ-CA variant was obtained by using CA (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) instead of DCDA under otherwise identical activation conditions.
