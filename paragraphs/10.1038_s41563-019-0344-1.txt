Synthesis of M/TiO 2 . Synthesis of silica nanoparticles. Spherical silica (SiO 2 ) nanoparticles were synthesized by sol–gel reaction in a basic environment following the previously reported Stöber method. A 0.86 ml volume of TEOS was added to a solution containing ethyl alcohol (23 ml), H 2 O (4.3 ml) and aqueous ammonia (0.6 ml) at room temperature. The mixture was then vigorously stirred for 6 h. Reaction products were centrifuged, washed with water and ethyl alcohol, and dispersed in ethyl alcohol.

Preparation of bulk Cu/TiO 2 reference. To fabricate the bulk Cu/TiO 2 reference, the synthesis was performed in the same manner as for M/TiO 2 HNP synthesis, as described in the previous section, but without using SiO 2 as a template or coating layer. First, TiO 2 was formed by a hydrolysis reaction, followed by Cu ion adsorption onto the TiO 2 surface and annealing at 900 °C for 2 h in air. The synthesized Cu/TiO 2 reference was used for further characterization and/or photocatalytic reactions.
