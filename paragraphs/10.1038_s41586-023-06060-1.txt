Synthesis of SACs The method used for synthesizing Co-SAC is based on our previ- ously reported method, with some modifications 36 . First, 1.0 g of o-phenylenediamine, 0.44 g of CoCl 2 and 2.0 g of SiO 2 nanoparti- cles (10–20 nm, Aldrich) templates were mixed together by using 20 ml 1.0 M HCl solution. Then, the mixed solution was sonicated for 0.5 h and stirred for another 0.5 h. Subsequently, 12 ml of 1.0 M HCl solution, which contains 3.0 g of ammonium peroxydisulfate, that is, (NH 4 ) 2 S 2 O 8 , was added dropwise into the above mixed solution with vigorous stirring. After polymerization in an ice bath for nearly one day, the mixture was dried using a rotary evaporator. Then, the dried powder was annealed under Ar atmosphere at 800 °C for 2 h. Finally, the product was treated by alkaline (2.0 M NaOH) and acid (2.0 M H 2 SO 4 ) leaching successively to remove SiO 2 nanoparticles templates and unstable Co-based species, respectively, to obtain the Co-SAC. We used the same method to prepare Ni-SAC. The only difference is that 0.405 g NiCl 2 ·6H 2 O and 1.0 g SiO 2 were used to syn- thesize Ni-SAC. Fe-SAC was obtained on the basis of our previous paper.

Synthesis of OCB catalysts OCB is synthesized on the basis of our previously reported method 7,45 . 2 g of commercially available XC-72 carbon (Vulcan XC-72, Fuel Cell Store) was added into a three-neck flask with 460 ml 70% HNO 3 solu- tion and 140 ml deionized water. The mixture was well stirred and refluxed at 80 °C for 24 h. The resulting slurry was washed with water and ethanol after natural cooling until the solution pH reached neu- tral, and the precipitate obtained was dried overnight at 80 °C in an oven.
