Preparation of nanoglues and support materials SiO 2 -supported CeO x . In general, OH − ions in alkaline solutions act as strong coordination agents for Ce 3+ ions to form cationic complexes, but excessive OH − results in precipitation of Ce(OH) 3 (solubility prod- uct constant K sp = 1.6 × 10 −20 ) 31 . To avoid the formation of Ce(OH) 3 pre- cipitates from the solution phase, the concentration of the OH − was carefully controlled to maintain a relatively stable aqueous solution containing soluble [Ce(OH) 2 ] + and [Ce(OH)] 2+ complexes 31 . Dissolved O 2 in the aqueous solution slowly oxidizes Ce 3+ into Ce 4+ , the concentration of which grows with time to reach the precipitation limit of Ce(OH) 4 (K sp = 2 × 10 −48 ) 31 . Under well controlled synthesis conditions, the strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA) of [Ce(OH) 2 ] + and [Ce(OH)] 2+ occurs within minutes 18 , a much shorter time than that needed for precipi- tating Ce(OH) 4 . Such a time difference in the dynamic adsorption and precipitation processes allows efficient, facile production of uniformly decorated high-surface-area SiO 2 with Ce species via the SEA process. In a typical procedure for synthesizing 12 wt% CeO x nanoglue islands on SiO 2 , 360 mg of fumed SiO 2 powder (Alfa Aesar, total Brunauer– Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area 278 m 2 g −1 ) was mixed with 100 ml of deionized (DI) water, and the resultant aqueous solution was soni- cated to produce a uniform mixture. Under vigorous stirring, 0.4 mmol of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 ·6H 2 O was dissolved in the above solution, and 0.8 ml of NH 3 ·H 2 O (2 M) was quickly injected into the solution with further stir- ring for 3 min prior to vacuum filtration. The final solution pH was about 8.7. The resultant precipitates were removed for air drying over- night at room temperature. The dried powders were ground to smaller particles and were then calcined in a muffle furnace at 500 or 600 °C (with a temperature ramp of 5 °C min −1 ) for 12 h. This facile synthesis protocol was easily scaled up to routinely produce 10 times more of the final product.
