Synthesis of the Au/CeO 2 catalyst The 6Au/CeO 2 catalyst was prepared by a deposition–precipitation method 47,48 . First, ceria was synthesized by a co-precipitation method. An aqueous solution of 10 g (NH 4 ) 2 Ce(NO 3 ) 6 (Sinopharm) in 100 ml H 2 O was co-precipitated with 1 g urea (Sinopharm) at 100 °C under vigorous stirring. After boiling for 8 h, the precipitate was washed twice with hot deionized water (50–70 °C), dried for 12 h at 120 °C, crushed into powder and calcined in air at 400 °C for 10 h. Next, 1.5 ml

Methods Synthesis of Au/α-MoC and other α-MoC-based catalysts An aqueous solution (6 ml for the 6Au/α-MoC) of 9.56 g Au l -1 HAuCl 4 was added dropwise to 20 ml of 57.35 g l -1 ammonium paramolyb- date ((NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 ·4H 2 O; Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.) at 80 °C (refs. 22,33). The solution was stirred at this temperature until the complete evaporation of water. The resulting solid was crushed into powder and then dried at 120 °C overnight. To prepare the Au/MoO 3 precursor, the powder was heated to 550 °C at a rate of 10 °C min −1 in air and maintained at this temperature for 4 h. The Au/MoO 3 precur- sor was then treated in 20% CH 4 /H 2 (100 ml min −1 ) according to the following heating protocol: from 25 to 300 °C at 10 °C min −1 , from 300 to 700 °C at 1 °C min −1 , constant at 700 °C for 2 h and then cooled to room temperature. The sample was then passivated using 2% O 2 /Ar at a flow rate of 60 ml min −1 for 6 h. The Pt/α-MoC, Pd/α-MoC, Ir/α-MoC, Rh/α-MoC and Ru/α-MoC catalysts were prepared following the same procedure using different metal-containing aqueous solutions, namely H 2 PtCl 6 , PdCl 2 , IrCl 3 , RhCl 3 and RuCl 3 , respectively. The as-synthesized noble metal-containing catalyst was obtained mainly in the α-MoC 1−x phase (Extended Data Figs. 2 and 4). Pure α-MoC consisting of mainly the α-MoC 1−x phase has previously been synthesized by a tandem nitri- dation–carbonization process 22 .

Results Catalyst screening wM/α-MoC catalysts (M = Au, Pt, Pd, Ir, Rh or Ru; w denotes wt%) with dif- ferent metal contents were synthesized by temperature-programmed carbonization of wM/MoO 3 samples in 20% CH 4 /H 2 at temperatures ranging from 25 to 700 °C, followed by oxidative passivation in 2% O 2 /Ar at 25 °C for 6 h before use 22 . The performances of these catalysts in the CO-H 2 O-AHE process were evaluated in an autoclave reactor with a feed gas of CO/C 2 H 2 /Ar (6:5:89) at 3.2 MPa and 15 ml H 2 O at differ- ent temperatures (Extended Data Fig. 1). The Au/α-MoC catalyst was screened as the optimum catalyst, exhibiting a high C 2 H 2 conversion of over 99% and CO conversion of 82% with a selectivity of 83% for C 2 H 4 , 11% for CH 3 CHO and 2% for CH 3 COOH at 80 °C (Fig. 1b,d, Extended Data Fig. 1a–d and Supplementary Table 1). The yield of C 2 H 4 over the 6Au/α-MoC catalyst was nearly eight times that over the 6Pt/α-MoC and 6Pd/α-MoC catalysts, and more than 26 times that over the 6Ir/α-MoC,
