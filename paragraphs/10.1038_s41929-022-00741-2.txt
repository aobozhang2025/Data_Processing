Methods Catalyst synthesis. CeO 2 nanorods were synthesized by a hydrothermal method as reported previously24–26. In a typical synthesis, 1.736 g of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 ·6H 2 O (Aldrich, 99.99%) was dissolved in 10 ml of deionized water then added dropwise to a concentrated NaOH solution, forming a mixed solution of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 . The concentrated NaOH solution was prepared by dissolving 19.2 g of NaOH (Aldrich, >98%) in 70 ml of deionized water. Then, the mixed solution of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 was maintained under vigorous stirring for 30 min before being transferred to a Teflon-lined, stainless steel autoclave for hydrothermal treatment at 100 °C for 24 h. Following hydrothermal synthesis, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature. The yellow powder thus obtained was washed with deionized water until its pH became neutral. Finally, the powder was dried at 60 °C in air for 10 h. This sample of CeO 2 nanorod was used as a support in the following preparation of the Rh 1 /CeO 2 catalyst. The Rh 1 /CeO 2 catalyst was prepared by the deposition–precipitation method27. In a typical synthesis, 1.0 g of CeO 2 nanorods was dispersed in 50 ml of deionized water. The mixture was sonicated for 10 min and stirred at 400 r.p.m. for 1 h; at this stage it is termed CeO 2 aqueous dispersion. Then, 5.6 mg of Rh (III) nitrate hydrate (Aldrich, ~36% Rh basis), which provided ~2.0 mg of Rh metal, was weighed and dissolved in 20 ml of deionized water. The prepared Rh salt solution was slowly introduced into the prepared CeO2 aqueous dispersion by syringe pump at a flow rate of 0.2 ml min–1 while the aqueous solution was being stirred, creating an aqueous mixture containing both Rh3+ and CeO2 nanorods. This aqueous mixture of Rh3+ and ceria nanorods was continuously stirred for an additional 3 h. The pH of the mixture was carefully adjusted to 9.5 by gradual introduction of ammonium hydroxide solution (Aldrich, 28%) while the aqueous mixture was being stirred, followed by continuous stirring for an additional 5 h. The aqueous mixture was then centrifuged at 3,000 r.p.m. for 5 min, after which the upper layer was decanted. The solid product thus obtained was dried at 60 °C in an oven overnight and calcined in a muffle furnace at 250 °C for 2 h to obtain the as-synthesized Rh1/CeO2 catalyst. The actual loading of Rh on CeO2 nanorods of the as-synthesized catalyst was measured by inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry, and was found to be 0.17 wt%. Thus, either 0.17 wt% Rh/CeO2 or Rh1/CeO2 is used interchangeably to denote the as-synthesized catalyst in the following sections.
