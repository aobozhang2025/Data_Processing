Commercial carbon black (1 g, Vulcan XC-72R, Fuel Cell Store) was first oxidized in a three-neck flask with nitric acid (10 M, 200 ml). Afterwards, under well-dispersed stirring conditions, the temperature was fixed at 90 °C for 12 h with a reflux system. After oxidation, the slurry was taken out, centrifuged and washed with deionized water and ethanol twice until the solution pH reached neutral. The sample was dried at 70 °C in a vacuum oven, and the resulting oxidized carbon black sample was denoted as C(O). One-hundred milligrams of the as-obtained C(O) was dispersed in 100 ml of Millipore-filtered water by tip sonication for 1 h to prepare a homogeneous dispersion. Then, 5 ml of InCl2, SnCl4 and SbCl3 glycol solution (0.5 mg ml−1) were added dropwise into carbon black dispersion under vigorous stirring for 12 h. Then, the mixture was frozen  quickly and entirely using liquid nitrogen. The mixed ice was melted at room temperature after irradiation by Xe lamp (>420 nm). The powder, obtained by rinsing and centrifuging with deionized water and ethanol, was dried at 60 °C in the vacuum oven for 12 h to obtain the In1/C(O), Sn1/C(O) and Sb1/C(O). As a comparison, Sn1/C was prepared using the carbon black as support.
