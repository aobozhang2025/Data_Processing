Synthesis of Cu-SAs/N-C. Following a normal procedure, the copper foam and powder of ZIF-8 (100 mg) were separately placed on a porcelain boat. The porcelain boat was heated in a tube furnace to 1,173 K (at 5 K min−1) in a stream of argon (10 ml min−1) for 1 h and then NH 3 (10 ml min−1) for 1 h to yield Cu- SAs/N-C. The yield of Cu-SAs/N-C was about 26 mg. The detailed scale-up process is shown in the Supplementary Video. The copper content was measured as 0.54 wt% based on ICP-AES analysis. For comparison, the copper foam and ZIF-8 were separately placed on the porcelain boat and heated to 1,173 K (at 5 K min−1) in a stream of argon (10 ml min−1) for 2 h to yield pyrolysed ZIF-8. Syntheses of Ni-SAs/N-C and Co-SAs/N-C were the same as for Cu-SAs/N-C, but using nickel foam or cobalt foam, respectively. Cu-NPs/N-C was prepared by extending the evaporation time to 5 h.

Synthesis of ZIF-8. Following a typical procedure, 0.558 g Zn(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O was dissolved in 20 ml methanol and subsequently added to 20 ml methanol containing 0.616 g 2-methylimidazole under ultrasound for 10 min at room temperature. The ZIF-8 was then grown under static at 308 K for 12 h. The precipitates were centrifuged, washed with methanol and dried in a vacuum at 338 K for overnight.

Synthesis of Cu-SAs/N-G. Copper foam and fluffy graphene oxide powder (50 mg) were placed separately on a porcelain boat and heated to 1,073 K (at 5 K min−1) for 1 h in a stream of NH 3 (10 ml min−1) to yield Cu-SAs/N-G. The copper content was measured as 1.26 wt% based on ICP-AES analysis.
