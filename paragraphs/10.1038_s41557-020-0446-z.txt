Methods Catalyst preparation. All carbon-supported gold catalysts were prepared by a previously reported wet impregnation method12. Activated carbon was initially ground to obtain a powder (150–200 mesh). The gold precursor, H[AuCl 4 ]·3H 2 O (Alfa Aesar, 20 mg, assay 49%), was dissolved in the organic solvent (2.7 ml). The gold precursor solution was then added dropwise, with stirring, to the activated carbon (0.99 g) to obtain a catalyst with a final metal loading of 1 wt.%. The resulting powder was dried at a temperature 5–10 °C higher than the boiling point of the solvent used for 16 h under a flow of N 2 . Wherever possible, extra dry solvents sealed under nitrogen were used. The Ru/C, Pt/C and Pd/C catalysts were prepared by the same wet impregnation procedure. In these cases, Ru(iii) acetylacetonate (Aldrich), Pd(ii) acetylacetonate (Aldrich) and Pt(ii) 2,4-pentanedionate (Alfa Aesar) were used as precursors.
