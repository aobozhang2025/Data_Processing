Methods Synthesis of catalysts BLG (>98%) was purchased from Davisco Foods International and puri- fied using a previously reported protocol 50 . For a detailed description of BLG fibril preparation, see ref. 51. For the synthesis of Fe SA @FibBLG, 100 mg lyophilized BLG fibril powder was dispersed in a mixture of 8.0 ml ethanol and 1.9 ml PEG200. The dispersion was then subjected to argon bubbling for 30 min to remove the dissolved oxygen, followed by irradiation under a xenon lamp with an ultraviolet filter (250–380 nm, 27.9 mW cm −2 , PLS-SXE300CUV) for 10 min to generate free radicals. Subsequently, 0.1 ml of 108.21 mg ml −1 Fe(NO 3 ) 3 ·9H 2 O EDTA solution was added dropwise to the dispersion of BLG fibrils under magnetic stirring for 12 h at 25 °C. Fe SA @BLG was prepared by the same synthe- sis procedure as for Fe SA @FibBLG, except that the BLG fibril powder was replaced by an equal amount of BLG powder. For the synthesis of FeNP@FibBLG, the as-obtained Fe SA @FibBLG dispersion was further ultraviolet-irradiated for 18 min under anaerobic conditions to reduce the iron ions. Finally, samples were collected by centrifugation at 4 °C, 11,100g for 10 min, washed by ethanol (10.0 ml × 6) and resuspended in 5.0 ml deionized water (pH 2). The powdered Fe SA @FibBLG, Fe SA @BLG and FeNP@FibBLG were obtained by lyophilization and stored at 4 °C.
