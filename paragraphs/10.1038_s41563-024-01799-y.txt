Synthesis of Pt-SA/TiO 2 Commercial anatase TiO 2 (50 mg) was dispersed in 10 ml H 2 O in a 20 ml vial under sonication for 10 min. Pt precursor solutions were prepared according to the same procedure as described in the Pt-DSA/TiO 2 part above. The Pt precursor solution was purged with Ar gas for 10 min; 0.5 ml of the Pt precursor solution was injected into the TiO 2 dispersion and vigorously stirred. After 20 min of stirring, the reaction solution was centrifuged and washed with water and ethanol. The product was dried in an electric oven at 50 °C overnight and used for the photo- catalytic HER reaction.

Synthesis of Pt-NP/TiO 2 Pt precursor solutions were made using a definite amount of H 2 PtCl 6 (17.50, 15.00, 12.50 and 6.25 μl for Pt-NPs and 0.70, 0.60, 0.50 and 0.25 wt% for TiO 2 , respectively). Then, 0.5 ml of the Pt precursor solu- tion was added into 10.0 ml of 20% methanol aqueous solution in a 20.0 ml gas-tight vial. The solution was purged with Ar gas for 10 min and irradiated with UV–vis light at an intensity of 100 mW cm –2 and vigorously stirred. After 1 h of irradiation, the reaction solution was centrifuged and the precipitation was dissolved in 2 ml H 2 O. The result- ing Pt-NP solution was mixed with 8 ml of aqueous TiO 2 dispersion, which contained 50 mg of commercial TiO 2 . After 20 min of stirring, the reaction solution was centrifuged and washed with water and ethanol. The product was dried in an electric oven at 50 °C overnight and used for photocatalytic reactions and/or characterizations.

Synthesis of Pt-DSA/TiO 2 Here 50 mg of commercial anatase TiO 2 was dispersed in 10 ml of 20% methanol aqueous solution in a 20 ml gas-tight vial under sonication for 10 min. A fixed amount of H 2 PtCl 6 (50.0, 37.5, 25.0 and 12.5 μl for Pt-DSA and 0.70, 0.60, 0.50 and 0.25 wt% TiO 2 , respectively) are diluted with H 2 O to make 1 ml of aqueous Pt precursor solutions. The TiO 2 dispersion and Pt precursor solution were purged with Ar gas for 10 min. The TiO 2 dispersion was vigorously stirred and simultaneously irradiated with UV–vis light at an intensity of 100 mW cm –2 using a xenon lamp light source (Newport). The light was irradiated for 20 min for each sample.

Synthesis of Pt-SA/hydrogenated TiO 2 The commercial anatase TiO 2 was reduced at 500 °C in a 10% H 2 /Ar atmosphere for 1 h. Then, 50 mg of the as-synthesized hydrogenated TiO 2 was dispersed in 10 ml of H 2 O in a 20 ml vial under sonication for 10 min. Furthermore, 50 μl of H 2 PtCl 6 was diluted with H 2 O to make 1.0 ml of an aqueous Pt precursor solution; 0.5 ml of the Pt precursor solution was injected into the TiO 2 dispersion and vigorously stirred. After 10 min of stirring, the reaction solution was centrifuged and washed with water and ethanol. The product was dried in an electric oven at 50 °C overnight and used for photocatalytic reactions and/or characterizations.

Synthesis of Ir- and Cu-DSA/TiO 2 In the case of Ir- and Cu-DSA/TiO 2 , basic synthesis procedures were similar to the method used for Pt-DSA/TiO 2 . The only different step was that definite amounts of H 2 IrCl 6 (2.2 mg) and CuCl 2 (5.4 mg) were added into 1 ml of H 2 O to make the Ir and Cu precursor solutions, respectively. The Ir and Cu precursor solutions were used instead of the Pt precursor solution to synthesize Ir- and Cu-DSA/TiO 2 , respectively.

Synthesis of M(Pt, Ir, Cu)-DSA/(ZnO, CeO 2 ) Basic synthesis procedures were similar to the method of metal-dynamically stabilized atom/TiO 2 . In this case, commercial ZnO or CeO 2 was used instead of commercial anatase TiO 2 . A fixed amount of H 2 PtCl 6 (50 μl), H 2 IrCl 6 (2.2 mg) and CuCl 2 (5.4 mg) were used to make 1 ml of H 2 O-diluted metal precursor solutions. The irradiation time of UV–vis light was fixed at 30 min.

Synthesis of M(Pt, Ir, Cu)-SA/hydrogenated supports (ZnO, CeO 2 ) Commercial ZnO and CeO 2 were reduced at 500 °C in a 10% H 2 /Ar atmos- phere for 1 h. Then, 50 mg of each of the hydrogenated supports was dispersed in 10 ml of H 2 O in a 20 ml vial under sonication for 10 min. The metal precursor solutions with the same concentrations as those used for each of the metal-dynamically stabilized atom/supports were prepared. Furthermore, 0.5 ml of the metal precursor solution was injected into the hydrogenated support dispersion and vigorously stirred. After 20 min of injecting the metal precursor solution, the reaction solution was centrifuged, washed and dried.
