Methods Catalyst synthesis. The NC support was prepared via a two-step synthesis, comprising the oxidative polymerization of aniline and a subsequent carbonization step42. Aniline (50 mmol, Acros, 99.5%) was dissolved in deionized water (40 cm3, pH 0.4; adjusted by hydrochloric acid, 1.25 M, Sigma-Aldrich, >37%), cooled to 277 K and subsequently added to a precooled solution (277 K) of ammonium persulfate (100 mmol, Acros, 98%) in deionized water (20 cm3) under vigorous stirring, using a magnetic stirring bar. Subsequently, the polyaniline slurry was kept for 24 h at room temperature without stirring, followed by filtering and washing with water (~0.75 l g−1). The formed polyaniline was dried in static air at 393 K for 12 h and carbonized at 1,073 K in N 2 atmosphere for 1 h with a heating rate of 5 K min−1. The obtained NC was ground and sieved into particles with a size of 0.4–0.6 mm. Commercial AC (Norit ROX 0.8) was immersed in aqua regia at room temperature to remove metal impurities. After filtration and thorough washing with deionized water (2 l g−1), the material was dried in static air at 393 K for 12 h and subsequently ground and sieved into particles with a size of 0.4–0.6 mm. All metal-based catalysts were prepared via an incipient wetness impregnation method (nominal metal loading of 1 wt%). Accordingly, a solution of the respective metal precursor, H 2 PtCl 6 (ABCR, 99.9%, 40.0 wt% Pt) and HAuCl 4 ∙xH 2 O (ABCR, 99.9%, 49.5 wt% Au) in water (1.5 cm3 g−1) or aqua regia (1.5 cm3 g−1), was added dropwise to the carbon carriers under continuous magnetic stirring for 2 h. Subsequently, all samples were dried at 473 K (static air, 16 h, heating rate = 5 K min−1) prior to thermal activation at higher temperatures, as indicated in the respective sample code (T act = 473–1,073 K, 16 h, N 2 for T act > 473 K, heating rate = 5 K min−1), yielding three series of Pt catalysts: (1) Pt/NC-w-T act , (2) Pt/AC-w-T act and (3) Pt/AC-a-T act . The reference gold single-atom catalysts, Au/NC and Au/AC, and the graphene- confined ruthenium-based system (Ru/NC) were obtained via thermal activation at 473 K (16 h, static air) and 1,073 K (16 h, N 2 atmosphere), respectively, using aqua regia as the impregnation solvent9,25. The sulfur modified Au–S/AC catalyst (1 wt% Au) was prepared according to a patented protocol43. Accordingly, an aqueous solution of HAuCl 4 ∙xH 2 O (0.1 cm3 mg−1) was added to an aqueous solution of ammonium thiosulphate (0.03 cm3 mg−1, Sigma-Aldrich, 98%). The resulting mixture was further diluted (1.5 cm3 g−1), added dropwise to the AC support under continuous magnetic stirring and dried (Tact = 378 K, 16 h, static air)
