Synthesis and characterization of a single-site Pt–Fe pair α-Fe 2 O 3 exposed by (012) facets is synthesized by adopting a previous method33 (see the Methods for details and Supplementary Fig. 1 for high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images). Ultralow platinum (Pt/Fe atom ratio of 1/1500) is then

Synthesis of α-Fe 2 O 3 (012) and α-Fe 2 O 3 (001). α-Fe 2 O 3 (012) and α-Fe 2 O 3 (001) were synthesized following the approach reported previously in refs. 28,33. For α-Fe 2 O 3 (012) synthesis, oleic acid (10 ml), NaOH (1.0 g) and ethanol (10 ml) were mixed by stirring at room temperature. Afterwards, ferric acetylacetonate aqueous solution (2 mmol Fe3+ in 20 ml of ultrapure water) was added to the mixed

Synthesis of a single-site Pt–Fe pair. A single-site Pt–Fe pair was synthesized using a photochemical deposition method in which H 2 PtCl 6 and methanol were used as a platinum source and sacrifice agent, respectively. Typically, 150 mg of Fe 2 O 3 (012) was suspended in a mixed solvent of 30 ml H 2 O and 10 ml methanol at room temperature. After a defined amount of H 2 PtCl 6 was added, the solution was degassed with argon gas for 30 min and then irradiated for 3 h under a xenon lamp. The catalysts were then centrifuged off, washed with water and freeze-dried.
