Methods Catalyst preparation. Commercial γ-alumina (99.97%, Alfa Aesar) was activated by pre-reduction flowing of 10% H 2 :N 2 at 350 ºC for 1 h to create coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ penta sites (rAl 2 O 3 ). The amounts of precious metal and ceria were 1 wt% and 10 wt%, respectively. A Ce(NO 3 ) 3 ·6H 2 O (99.99%, Kanto chemical) with the amount of 38 mg was homogeneously dissolved in 5 ml of deionized water with stirring. The rAl 2 O 3 (133.5 mg) was introduced into the cerium precursor solution, and then the solution was continuously stirred at room temperature for 1 h (CeO 2 –rAl 2 O 3 ). The solution was then heated to the target impregnation temperature (40, 60, 80 or 90 ºC). In the case of the Pt catalysts, 4 mg of H 2 PtCl 6 ·6H 2 O (≤100%, Sigma-Aldrich) was homogeneously dissolved in 5 ml of deionized water, and then the Pt precursor solution was put into the CeO 2 –rAl 2 O 3 solution with stirring. The solution was evaporated completely. The resulting powder was dried overnight at 80 ºC, and the dried powder was calcined in static air at 500 ºC for 5 h. Finally, the calcined powder was reduced in 10% H 2 :N 2 at 500 ºC for 2 h, producing the Pt/CeO 2 –rAl 2 O 3 catalyst. For the Pd or Rh catalysts, H 2 PdCl 4 or H 2 RhCl 5 solution was prepared with a 2:1 molar ratio of HCl to PdCl 2 (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) or RhCl 3 ·xH 2 O (99.98%, Sigma-Aldrich). The other procedures were the same as those for Pt/CeO 2 –rAl 2 O 3 , resulting in Pd/CeO 2 –rAl 2 O 3 or Rh/CeO 2 –rAl 2 O 3 . For the M/CeO 2 –Al 2 O 3 (M/CA) catalysts, ceria and precious metal were sequentially impregnated onto fresh γ-alumina. For the M/rAl 2 O 3 (M/rA) catalysts, precious metal was impregnated onto activated γ-alumina without ceria impregnation. Metal impregnation was performed at 40 ºC for both the M/CA and M/rA catalysts. The other procedures were the same as those for the M/CeO 2 –rAl 2 O 3 catalysts.
