Methods Synthesis of M–NHGFs. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise specified. Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized by oxidation of natural graphite flakes (100 mesh) following a modified Hummers’ method61. The M–NHGFs (M = Fe, Co, Ni) were synthesized using a two-step process. In a typical procedure for synthesizing Ni–NHGF, 50 µ l of 3 mg ml–1 NiCl 2 · 6H 2 O and 15 µ l of 30% H 2 O 2 were added into 10 ml of 2 mg ml–1 GO suspension and sonicated for 1 h. The mixed suspension was hydrothermally treated at 180 °C for 6 h, forming a porous hydrogel. After freeze drying, the gel was placed in the center of 1-inch quartz tube furnace and annealed at 900 °C for 1 h with flows of Ar (100 sccm) and NH 3 (50 sccm) to obtain Ni–NHGF. As control samples, non-holey Ni–NGF was prepared without the addition of H 2 O 2 during the hydrothermal process and metal-free NHGF was prepared without the addition of Ni precursor. Fe–NHGF and Co–NHGF were prepared by the same procedure but changing the metal precursor to 2 mg ml–1 FeCl 3 and 3 mg ml–1 CoCl 2 · 6H 2 O, respectively.
