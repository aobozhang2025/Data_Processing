Synthesis. Preparation of Ir 1 /CN. In a typical procedure, Zn(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O (0.594 g, 2 mmol) and Ir(acac) 3 (97.9 mg, 0.20 mmol) were simultaneously dissolved in 7.5 ml methanol to form a clear solution, which was then added into 15 ml of methanol containing 2-methyl imidazole (0.656 g, 8 mmol). After vigorously stirring for 5 min, the mixed solutions were transferred into a 50 ml Telfon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. The sealed vessel was heated at 120 °C for 4 h before it was cooled to room temperature. The Ir(acac) 3 @ZIF-8 nanocrystal was collected by centrifugation, washed four times with methanol and dried in vacuum overnight. Ir(acac) 3 @ZIF-8 can be prepared by the following procedure: Zn(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O (1.069 g, 3.6 mmol) and Ir(acac) 3 (176 mg, 0.36 mmol) were dissolved in 15 ml methanol at the same time; the resulting solution was then added into 10 ml of methanol containing 1.161 g (14.2 mmol) 2-methyl imidazole. After vigorously stirring for 5 min, the mixed solutions were kept at room temperature without stirring for 20 h. The Ir(acac) 3 @ZIF-8 nanocrystal was collected by centrifugation, washed four times with methanol and dried in vacuum overnight. The powder of Ir(acac) 3 @ ZIF-8 was then placed in a tube furnace and heated to 900 °C for 3 h at the heating rate of 5 °C min–1 under argon gas (200 ml min–1). The result powder was calcined twice again with the same condition as above. After calcination, the samples were cooled to room temperature to obtain Ir 1 /CN.

Preparation of M 1 /CN (M = Pt, Pd, Ru, Mo, Ga, Cu, Ni, Mn). A solution of Zn(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O (1.069 g, 3.6 mmol) and metal acetylacetonates (M = Pt, Pd, Ru, Cu, Ni, Mn) (0.22–0.36 mmol) were dissolved in 15 ml methanol (30 ml methanol for M = Pd) at 30–55 °C; the resulting solution was subsequently added to 10 ml of methanol containing 2-methyl imidazole (1.161 g, 14.2 mmol). After vigorously stirring for 5 min, the mixed solutions were kept at room temperature without stirring for 20 h. The solid products were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with methanol and dried in vacuum overnight. In a typical procedure, a clear solution of Zn(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O (0.594 g, 2 mmol) and metal acetylacetonates (M = Ga, Mo; 0.10–0.12 mmol) were dissolved in 7.5 ml methanol at 30–55 °C. The resulting solution was subsequently added to 15 ml of methanol containing 2-methyl imidazole (0.656 g, 8 mmol). After vigorously stirring for 5 min, the mixed solutions were transferred into a 50 ml Telfon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. The sealed vessel was heated at 120 °C for 4 h before it was cooled down to room temperature. The solid products were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with methanol and dried in a vacuum overnight. The powders of the metal acetylacetonates @ZIF-8 were placed in a tube furnace and heated to 800/900 °C for 3 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 under argon gas (200 ml min–1). After calcination, the samples were cooled to room temperature to obtain M 1 /CNs. Please refer to Supplementary Table 3 for the metal acetylacetonates (M = Pt, Ir, Pd, Ru, Mo, Ga, Cu, Ni, Mn) feed in synthesis.
