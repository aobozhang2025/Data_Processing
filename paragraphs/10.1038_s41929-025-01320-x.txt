Results Synthesis and characterization The siliceous MFI zeolite modulated Co catalyst was synthesized with a hydrothermal strategy using Co salts, tetraethyl orthosilicate, tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH), urea and water in a gel with a composition of 1.0 SiO 2 /0.97 TPAOH/30 H 2 O/0.83 urea/0.1 Co 2+ (mole ratio). After crystallization at 180 °C, calcination to remove the organic template, and washing with nitric acid at 80 °C three times (details are provided in the Methods) to remove the excess Co spe- cies, a sample (denoted CoS-1) with a Co loading of ~0.5 wt% was obtained (Supplementary Fig. 1). Usually, hydrothermal synthesis of metal-containing zeolites results in unstable metal species (for exam- ple, extra-framework Co), and washing with nitric acid is necessary for selective removal of these undesired Co species. X-ray diffraction patterns of the CoS-1 showed peaks typically assigned to the MFI zeo- lite structure with high crystallinity (Supplementary Fig. 2). Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the CoS-1 showed zeolite crystals with an average size of ~500 nm (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). N 2 sorption of the CoS-1 gave type-I isotherms with a surface area of 358.4 m 2 g −1 (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6).

Synthesis of Co/Al 2 O 3 , Co/TiO 2 , Co/SiO 2 and CoNP/S-1 As a typical run for the synthesis of Co/Al 2 O 3 , 6 g of Al 2 O 3 was mixed with 6 ml of aqueous Co(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O solution (Co concentration of 0.085 mol l −1 ), followed by ultrasonic treatment for 1 h and static treat- ment overnight at room temperature. The suspensions were then stirred for 2 h in air at 120 °C until the water was completely evapo- rated. Following calcination at 650 °C for 4 h in air, Co/Al 2 O 3 was finally obtained. The Co/TiO 2 , Co/SiO 2 and CoNP/S-1 were synthesized follow- ing the same procedures, except for using TiO 2 , SiO 2 and S-1 as supports. The Co loading on Co/Al 2 O 3 , Co/SiO 2 and CoNP/S-1, obtained based on ICP analysis, was 0.47, 0.51 and 0.58 wt%, respectively.

Synthesis of self-prepared PtSn/Al 2 O 3 SnCl 2 ·2H 2 O (400 mg) was dissolved in 10 ml of dilute nitric acid (1 M), then 2 ml of the SnCl 2 solution was added to 3.0 g of nanosized γ-Al 2 O 3 (20 nm), followed by ultrasonic treatment for 1 h, then static treatment overnight at room temperature. The mixture was next stirred for 2 h at 120 °C until the water was completely evaporated. After calcination at 550 °C in flowing humid air (50 ml min −1 , 20 vol% water in air), the Sn/Al 2 O 3 support was obtained. A 1.5-ml volume of H 2 PtCl 6 aque- ous solution (Pt concentration of 0.033 M) was applied to 2 g of Sn/Al 2 O 3 , followed by ultrasonic treatment for 1 h, then static treat- ment overnight at room temperature. The mixture was stirred for 2 h at 120 °C until the water was completely evaporated. After calcination at 550 °C in flowing humid air (50 ml min −1 , 20 vol% water in air), 1 g of the obtained powder was mixed with 1 ml of KNO 3 aqueous solu- tion (0.05 M) to eliminate acid sites. Following reduction at 500 °C in flowing hydrogen (50 ml min −1 , 20% H 2 in Ar), PtSn/Al 2 O 3 catalyst was obtained. Residual Cl species on the catalyst surface were excluded by XPS characterization.

Synthesis of CoS-1 TPAOH solution (100 g; 40 wt% in water), 42 g of TEOS and 21 g of deionized water were stirred at room temperature for 8 h, then 6.0 g of Co(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O was pre-dissolved in 30 ml of deionized water and mixed with the above solution, followed by adding 10 g of urea. After stirring for another 2 h, the mixture was transferred into an autoclave and thermally heated at 180 °C for three days. After washing with water, drying at 100 °C and calcining in air at 650 °C for 4 h to remove the organic template, raw powder was obtained. This powder was washed with nitric acid to remove the Co oxide crystals/nanoparticles that might exist on the zeolite external surface or within the micropores. In a typical run for acid washing, 5 g of powder was stirred in 200 ml of aqueous nitric acid solution (4 M) at 80 °C for 10 h. After filtration

Synthesis of S-1 TPAOH solution (100 g; 40 wt% in water), 42 g of TEOS and 21 g of deion- ized water were stirred at room temperature for 10 h, then the mixture was transferred into an autoclave and thermally heated at 180 °C for three days. After washing with water, drying at 100 °C and calcining in air at 650 °C for 4 h to remove the organic template, S-1 zeolite was obtained.
