Material synthesis The nitrogen-doped carbon support was synthesized from a two-dimensional zeolitic imidazolate framework (2D-ZIF-8). The metal–organic framework was typically synthesized by dissolving 12.75 g zinc nitrate hexahydrate and 29.15 g 2-methyl imidazole separately in deionized water (DIW) (250 ml each). After mixing the two solutions, the mixture was stirred for 2 h and left still for 16 h. The resulting precipitate was filtered off, washed with DIW (3 l) and ethanol (1 l), and dried at 80 °C. The obtained 2D-ZIF-8 was mixed with KCl (20 g per g metal–organic framework), which was previ- ously dissolved in water (0.5 g ml −1 ). The water was removed in a rotary evaporator and then the solid was dried in a vacuum oven set a 80 °C. CN was obtained after carbonization at 700 °C (5 h, N 2 flow, 2 °C min −1 heating rate) and a washing treatment consisting of hydrochloric acid (2 M in water), deionized water and ethanol followed by drying at 80 °C. Pt introduction was achieved using a wet impregnation method 32 . A target amount of chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H 2 PtCl 6 .6H 2 O) was dissolved in 20 ml DIW and added to 250 mg NC. After sonication for 15 min, the water was evaporated and the powder dried at 80 °C overnight. The first annealing step was carried out at 200 °C (5 h, N 2 flow, 5 °C min −1 heating rate). The catalyst was then suspended in a 1 M NH 4 Cl solution, sonicated for 30 min and removed by centrifugation. This process was repeated twice more with the 1 M NH 4 Cl solution and three more times with DIW. After another drying step, the material was annealed a second time at 550 °C (5 h, N 2 flow, 2 °C min −1 heating rate). The Pt@PTI sample was reported in a previous study 5 , from which Pt-PTI/773 was selected for the current work. The Pt@SiO 2 sample was prepared according to the procedure reported in ref. 12. Molecular compounds were either purchased (K 2 PtCl 4 , fluorochem, 99 %; Pt(NH 3 ) 4 Cl 2 .xH 2 O, Merck, 98 %) or synthetized according to reported procedures (cis-Ptpy 2 Cl 2 ; (tmeda)PtMe 2 )
