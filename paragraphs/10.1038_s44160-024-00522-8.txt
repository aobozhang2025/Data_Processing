To prepare Pd/TiO2, we began by cutting titanium plates (TP) into small pieces (2.5 × 4.5 cm) and sonicating them in acetone, ethanol and distilled water for 30 min each. These pieces were then placed in a 50 ml Teflon-lined autoclave containing 40 ml of 5 M NaOH aqueous solution  100 80 60 40 20 0  0  20  40  60  80  100  FENO3  – (%)  j (mA cm–2)  Photocatalysis  Commercial  electricity  Production profit (USD per  kilogram of HNO3)  0.15  0.55  0.4  0  0  0.4  Renewable  electricity  0  1,000  2,000  3,000  4,000  5,000  Generated NO3  − (μmol)  1 cm−2 cell  0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200  0  5  10  15  20  25  30  35  Time (h)  Cell FE (NO3  −) (%)  1  2  Voltage (V)  Current density: 15 mA cm−2  Flowrate: 18 ml h−1  NO3  − productivity: 5.84 nmol s−1  Air  O2 + H2O H2O2  NO3  −  Air Renewable energy NO3  Electrolyte  Pd/TiO2  Carbon nanofibres N2 + H2O2  Cathode  Anode  Direct electrochemical process  CH4 H2O  O2 N2 (from air)  Steam reforming  P: 14−40 atm.

After cooling to room temperature, the samples were washed multiple times with de-ionized (DI) water and ethanol, dried at 60 °C for 2 h. The samples were then immersed in 0.25 M Pd(NO3)2 solution for 1 h to exchange Na+ ions with Pd2+. The resulting PdTi2O5·H2O/TP was rinsed with DI water and ethanol multiple times and dried at 60 °C for 2 h. The samples were then annealed in a tube furnace at 500 °C under an Ar atmosphere for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, the final product, Pd/TiO2/TP, was obtained. The only difference for the preparation of Ru, Rh, Ir, Pt and TiO2/TP is to soak the sample in 1 m HCl for 1 h to exchange Na+ with Ru3+, Rh3+, Ir3+, Pt2+ and H+. At last, two titanium sheets (2 × 4 cm) loaded with Pd/TiO2 were placed in 10 ml of ethanol and peeled off with an ultrasonic cell disruptor for 1 h. Subsequently, the obtained dispersion was centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 10 min, and the precipitate containing Pd/TiO2 nanosheets was thoroughly washed with DI water and ethanol. We obtained CrO2, Mn3O4, Fe3O4 and Co3O4 from Aladdin Ltd.
