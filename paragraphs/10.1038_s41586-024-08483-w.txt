Synthesis of Pt/SiO 2 catalyst The reference Pt/SiO 2 catalyst was synthesized using the wetness impregnation method. H 2 PtCl 6 solution (800 µl) of appropriate con- centration was added to 1 g of hydrophilic SiO 2 powder. The mixture was stirred until dry and further dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight. The catalyst was reduced at 350 °C for 2 h under 10% H 2 /90% Ar before catalytic evaluation or characterizations.

Synthesis of γ-Mo 2 N γ-Mo 2 N was synthesized using a temperature-programmed nitridation technique. Ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 ·4H 2 O) powder (10 g) was calcined in a muffle furnace at 500 °C for 10 h to synthesize MoO 3 . Subsequently, 2 g of untreated MoO 3 powder was nitridated in pure ammonia flow (200 ml min −1 ) by the following temperature-programmed procedure: heated from room tempera- ture to 350 °C at a rate of 10 °C min −1 , then to 450 °C at 0.5 °C min −1 and finally to 785 °C at 2 °C min −1 . The sample was held at 785 °C for an additional 4 h. The sample was then cooled down to room temperature and subjected to passivation using 0.5% O 2 /Ar (60 ml min −1 ) as the pas- sivation gas overnight to yield the γ-Mo 2 N powder.

Synthesis of α-MoC α-MoC was synthesized through a two-step temperature-programmed nitridation–carburization approach. Initially, 1 g of MoO 3 powder was heated in pure ammonia (160 ml min −1 ) from room temperature to 700 °C at a rate of 5 °C min −1 and maintained at 700 °C for 2 h. After the nitridation process, the sample was cooled down to room temperature, then heated in 20% CH 4 /80% H 2 (160 ml min −1 ) to 700 °C at 5 °C min −1 and held at 700 °C for 2 h. The sample was then cooled down to room temperature and subsequently subjected to passivation using 0.5% O 2 /Ar as the passivation gas overnight to obtain the α-MoC powder.
