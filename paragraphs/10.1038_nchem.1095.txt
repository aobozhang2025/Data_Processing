Methods Sample preparation. Both The single-atom Pt1/FeOx catalyst (denoted as sample A, with a Pt/Fe atomic ratio of 1/1430 and a Pt loading of 0.17  weight percent (wt%)) and a similar catalyst with a Pt loading of 2.5 wt% (denoted as sample B, with a Pt/Fe atomic ratio of 1/95) were prepared by co-precipitation of an aqueous solution of chloroplatinic acid (H 2 PtCl 6 . 6H 2 O, 7.59 Ã— 10 22 mol l 21 ) and ferric nitrate (Fe(NO 3 ) 3 . 9H 2 O, 1 mol l 21 ) with sodium carbonate (Na 2 CO 3 , 1 mol l 21 ) at 50 8C, with the pH value of the resulting solution controlled at about 8. The recovered solid was dried at 60 8C for five hours and calcined at 400 8C for five hours. Prior to being characterized and tested, the samples were reduced in 10% H 2 /He at 200 8C for 0.5 hours. The actual Pt loadings in the two samples, determined by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy on an IRIS Intrepid II XSP instrument (Thermo Electron Corporation), were 0.17 wt% for sample A and 2.50 wt% for sample B.
