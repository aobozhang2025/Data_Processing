Methods Chemicals and synthesis All the chemicals are used as received from the provider without further purification. Tetraamminepalladium(II) nitrate solution (TAPN, 10 wt.% in H 2 O, 99.99%) and cerium(III) nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO 3 ) 3 ·6H 2 O, 99.995%) obtained from Sigma Aldrich were used as the precursors of Pd and CeO 2 . Gamma phase of aluminium oxide (CATALOX SBa-150) from Sasol was pre-calcined at 850 °C in air for 6 h and used as the refer- ence catalyst support. Single-atom Pd 1 /CeO 2 catalyst was prepared via incipient wetness impregnation followed by high-temperature calcina- tion as reported previously. Firstly, CeO 2 support with mild crystallinity was obtained via thermal decomposition of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 ·6H 2 O at 350 °C in air for 2 h. After impregnation of TAPN (1 wt.% Pd), the powders were dried overnight at 80 °C followed by calcination in static air at 800 °C for 8 h with a ramp of 5 °C min −1 . Traditional Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalyst domi- nated by supported PdO NPs was prepared by impregnating commer- cial γ-Al 2 O 3 with TAPN (1 wt.% Pd), drying the impregnated support in air at 80 °C, and calcining the powders in static air at 550 °C for 5 h with a ramp of 5 °C min −1 . The resulted catalyst was denoted as PdO/Al 2 O 3 .

Results RT activation of Pd 1 /CeO 2 for CH 4 combustion Single-atom Pd 1 /CeO 2 (1 wt.% Pd) catalyst was prepared by incipi- ent wetness impregnation, followed by 800 °C calcination in air, namely the atom-trapping process 29 . The single-atom nature of Pd 1 in as-synthesized catalyst was confirmed by combined electron micros- copy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2, and Supplementary Table 1). The conventional PdO/Al 2 O 3 catalyst (1 wt.% Pd) with PdO NPs supported on a high-surface-area γ-Al 2 O 3 was also prepared using a solution impregnation method (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4, and Supplementary Table 2) 30 . Both catalysts were evalu- ated in lean methane oxidation under industrially relevant conditions for emission control of natural gas vehicles (NGVs), including a low CH 4 concentration (680 ppm), presence of CO 2 and steam, and high gas hourly space velocity of 300 l g −1 h −1 (ref. 1).
