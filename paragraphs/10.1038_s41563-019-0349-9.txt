Methods Catalyst preparation. The synthesis of Pt iso catalysts on TiO 2 has been reported previously22. Briefly, a pH-adjusted solution (12.2) containing tetraammineplatinum(II) nitrate was slowly injected into a solution containing TiO 2 (anatase, 5 nm diameter, 290 m2 g−1, US Research Nanomaterials). After drying, the catalyst was calcined in a tube furnace at 450 °C for 4 h in flowing air after ramping up the temperature at a rate of 10 °C min−1.
