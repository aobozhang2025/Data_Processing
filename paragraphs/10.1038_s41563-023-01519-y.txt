M–TiO 2 preparation MIL-125 was well dispersed in deionized water via sonication, fol- lowed by the addition of a metal–salt with the designed weight ratio (for example, 0.75 wt% metal on MIL-125). After stirring for 2 hours, the mixture was centrifuged at a centrifugal force of 1,236.26g for 5 min to obtain metal–MIL-125 (named the ion-coordination method). The TiO 2 with various metal loadings (including Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru and Pt) was obtained by calcination of the solid at differ- ent temperatures (400–600 °C) in a muffle oven to form M–TiO 2 . Various Cu ratios were loaded on MIL-125, followed by calcination, to obtain Cu–TiO 2 , with the ratios later determined by MP-AES to be 0.16%, 0.85%, 1.53%, 1.82% and 2.42%. The Cu–TiO 2 in this study was 1.53% Cu–TiO 2 unless otherwise mentioned. To investigate the affect of different conditions, different calcination temperatures and times were applied to the Cu–TiO 2 synthesis. For pure TiO 2 , MIL-125 was directly put in a muffle furnace (Carbolite, CWF 1300) for annealing at 500 °C for 3 h.

PtCu–TiO 2 synthesis Pt was induced on Cu–TiO 2 by an in situ photodeposition method. Typically, 5 mg Cu–TiO 2 and 0.5 wt% H 2 PtCl 6 were dispersed into 40 ml 70% methanol aqueous solution. Then, the solution was purged with argon for 20 min to remove oxygen and sealed for postdeposition induced by a 365 nm light-emitting diode (LED) to form PtCu–TiO 2 . The preparation of Pt–TiO 2 followed the same procedure except TiO 2 was used as the substrate. The samples for characterization were obtained by 30 min irradiation using 50 mg Cu–TiO 2 to obtain a good signal-to-noise ratio. From MP-AES, the Pt amount of the PtCu–TiO 2 and Pt–TiO 2 was analysed to be 0.25% and 0.17%, respec- tively. The optimal sample 1.53% Cu 0.25% Pt–TiO 2 was called PtCu–TiO 2 in this study, while 0.17% Pt–TiO 2 was called Pt–TiO 2 , unless specifically otherwise stated.
