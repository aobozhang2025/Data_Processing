Synthesis of Ir/SiO 2 , IrO 2 and Ir/MgO-NP. Silica-supported Ir nanoparticles were prepared as a reference according to a previously reported method50. Iridium oxide materials were synthesized via a modified chlorine-free Adams fusion method44,67. MgO-NP-supported Ir single site catalysts were prepared as follows. To MgO-NP (200 mg; see the first step in the preparation of the MgO(111) nanosheet support (Synthesis of the support)) in pentane (20 ml) in a 50 ml Schlenk flask was added Ir(COD)(acac) (0.4 mg) dissolved in pentane (2 ml) with stirring. The resulting suspension was stirred for 3 h at room temperature. After solvent removal, the material was washed with pentane, dried under a high vacuum (10–5 mbar) and calcined using the same protocol as for Ir/MgO-cal. The thus-obtained light-yellow powder was denoted as Ir/MgO-NP.

Methods Synthesis of the support. Mg(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O (99.97% metals basis, Alfa Aesar) and Na 2 CO 3 were purchased and used as received. Deionized water was further purified using a Merck Millipore Synergy Ultrapure Water System and had a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm at 25 °C. The well-defined single-crystalline MgO(111) nanosheets as the support were prepared according to a previously reported procedure28. A Na 2 CO 3 aqueous solution (100 ml, 0.5 M) was rapidly added into 400 ml of a Mg(NO 3 ) 2 aqueous solution (0.125 M) under vigorous stirring at room temperature. After 10 min, the precipitation was collected via filtration, washed with deionized water and ethanol, and then dried under a reduced pressure. The yielded white powder was transferred into an alumina crucible and calcined at 500 °C (the ramping rate was controlled at 2 °C min–1) for 2 h under an air atmosphere. The MgO product was added into deionized water (1 mg ml–1) under stirring at room temperature. After 1 h, the product was collected via filtration and dried under a reduced pressure. the Mg(OH) 2 product was heated to 600 °C for 12 h under a high vacuum. During both the ramping and heating processes, the reactor was evacuated with pressure lower than 10–5 mbar. The ramping rate was 1 °C min–1. The final product was collected and stored in an argon-filled glove box, denoted as MgO-NS and used as the support.

Results Synthesis and characterization. Single-crystalline MgO(111) nanosheets were prepared according to a recently reported proce- dure28; they are ultrathin and preferentially oriented, with only (111) facets exposed. These MgO(111) nanosheets offer well-defined sur- face sites, namely three-coordinated –O2– anions and isolated –OH groups (2Mg–OH nm–2), and are thus ideally suited to serve as a support for SOMC. The nanosheets were contacted with Ir(COD) (acac) (COD, cyclooctadiene; acac, acetylacetonate) in pentane for three hours. The consumption of Mg–OH (3,573 cm−1), together with the appearance of bridging –O–H (3,513 and 3,374 cm−1) and C–H (3,080–2,840 cm−1) stretches according to infrared spectros- copy (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1) supports an anchoring process via grafting (Fig. 1a). On grafting, the C=O stretch of the acac ligands shifted from 1,565 to 1618 cm−1, which is consistent with the transfer of the ligand from iridium to magnesium. In fact,

Synthesis of iridium complexes as homogeneous catalysts. Ir(O,O-acac) 2 (C-acac) (H 2 O) was synthesized according to refs. 36,65,66 with a slight change. In a round-bottom flask equipped with a reflex condenser, 1 g of IrCl 3 ·H 2 O x , 1 g of NaHCO 3 and 10 ml of acetylacetone were added. The mixture was heated to 135 °C under N 2 and allowed to reflux for 48 h. After cooling to room temperature, a yellow precipitate was collected by filtration and washed with acetylacetone and dichloromethane (~75 %yield). The yellow solid was dissolved in H 2 O under vigorous stirring and used as a concentrated solution for the synthesis of Ir(O,O-acac) 2 (C-acac)(py). 1H NMR (D 2 O): δ = 5.58 (s, 2H, CH), 5.46 (s, 1H, CH), 1.99 (s, 12H, CH 3 ). 13C NMR (D 2 O + CD 3 OD): δ = 217.8 (s, C-acac, C=O), 187.9 (s, O-acac, C=O), 104.4 (s, O-acac, CH), 49.9 (s, C-acac, CH), 33.1 (s, C-acac, CH 3 ), 28.1 (s, O-acac, CH 3 ). Ir(O,O-acac) 2 (C-acac)(py) was synthesized as follows. A concentrated water solution of Ir(O,O-acac) 2 (C-acac)(H 2 O) that contained 200 mg of the above complex was mixed with 20 ml of CHCl 3 and 2 ml of pyridine. The mixture was stirred and heated at 60 °C overnight. The solvent was removed under vacuum to give a quantitative yield of Ir(O,O-acac) 2 (C-acac)(py). 1H NMR (CD 3 Cl): δ = 8.26 (m, 2H, py), 7.83 (m, 1H, py), 7.34 (m, 2H, py), 5.29 (s, 2H, CH), 5.27 (s, 1H, CH), 1.92 (s, 12H, CH 3 ). 13C NMR (CD 3 Cl): δ = 213.5 (s, C-acac, C=O), 185.1 (s, O-acac, C=O), 149.8 (s, py), 138.4 (s, py), 125.1 (s, py), 103.1 (s, O-acac, CH), 40.2 (s, C-acac, CH), 31.9 (s, C-acac, CH 3 ), 27.6 (s, O-acac, CH 3 ). Ir(O,O-acac) 2 (Ph)(py) was formed by heating Ir(O,O-acac) 2 (C-acac)(py) with benzene at 180 °C in an airtight Fisher-Porter reactor. The complex was converted into Ir(O,O-acac) 2 (Ph)(py). 1H NMR (CD 3 Cl): δ = 8.52 (m, 2H, py), 7.83 (m, 1H, py), 7.41 (m, 2H, py), 6.99 (m, 5H, Ph), 5.14 (s, 2H, CH), 1.80 (s, 12H, CH 3 ). 13C NMR (CD 3 Cl): δ = 184.6 (s, O-acac, C=O), 149.7 (s, py), 137.7 (s, py), 125.1 (s, py), 137.3 (s, Ph), 135.9 (s, Ph), 125.4 (s, Ph), 122.9 (s, Ph), 103.3 (s, O-acac, CH), 27.2 (s, O-acac, CH 3 ).

Synthesis of Ir-based catalysts. (Acetylacetonato)(1,5-cyclooctadiene)iridium(I) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Pentane was dried using an MBraun solvent purification system (SPS 800), and stored in the presence of 4 Å molecule sieves in a glove box. Synthetic air and H 2 were purified over activated 4 Å molecular sieves. All the experiments (support handling, material synthesis, storage and regular characterization) were performed under a N 2 or Ar atmosphere in an MBraun UNIlab glove box (water and oxygen levels were kept below 0.1 ppm) or standard Schlenk techniques. Elemental analyses were performed by Mikroanalytisches Labor Pascher. To MgO-NS (200 mg) dispersed in pentane (20 ml) in a 50 ml Schlenk flask was added a solution of Ir(COD)(acac) (4.15 mg) in pentane (2 ml) under stirring. The resulting suspension was stirred for 3 h at room temperature. After removing the solvent in vacuo, the resulting material was washed with pentane and dried under a high vacuum (10–5 mbar) to give Ir(COD)(acac)/MgO (elemental analysis, Ir, 0.9%; Ir:C ≈ 1:15). The 0.1 wt% sample was prepared in the same manner using 0.4 mg of Ir(COD)(acac). Ir(COD)(acac)/MgO was added to a tubular glass flow reactor supported by a frit. The reactor was heated, ramping at 1 °C min–1 to 400 °C and kept at 400 °C for 12 h under a steady flow of synthetic air. After cooling down to room temperature, the reactor was evacuated under a high vacuum to yield a light-yellow powder and denoted as Ir/MgO-cal (elemental analysis, Ir, 0.9%).
