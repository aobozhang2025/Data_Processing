Methods Preparation of photocatalysts Unless otherwise stated, the purities of all reagents for photocatalyst preparation and for photoelectrochemical measurements are above the analytical grade. The pristine PCN was prepared according to the reported method 24 . In a typical synthesis of KPCN, 5.95 g of potassium bromide was added into the synthesis. Specifically, melamine (4.0 g, Alfa Aesar) was ground with KBr (5.95 g, Alfa Aesar) in 3 ml ethanol (Et-OH) and 1 ml glycol in an agate mortar for 1 h. After drying at 65 °C, the resultant mixture was heated to 560 °C for 4 h at a ramping rate of 2.2 °C min −1 in a tube furnace (inner diameter 4 cm) in N 2 atmos- phere (50 ml min −1 ). After cooling to room temperature, the bright yellow-green product was ball milled (400 rpm, 3 h) with ZrO 2 balls of Ф ≈ 0.4 mm in Et-OH. The sample was washed by boiling deion- ized water several times, collected by filtration and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 12 h. The AuPCN and AuKPCN were prepared by a chemical deposition method as follows: a certain amount of PCN or KPCN was dispersed in 26 ml water under sonication for 60 min at 60 °C, followed by adding a certain amount of HAuCl 4 . The mixture was then bubbled with N 2 for 30 min (100 ml min −1 ). The reaction system was carefully sealed and then heated to 60 °C for 8 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the sample was washed by deionized water and Et-OH several times, collected by filtration and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 12 h. The detailed orthogonal experimental results are discussed in the corresponding supplementary figures.
