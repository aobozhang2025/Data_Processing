Methods Catalyst preparation All chemical reagents were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochem- ical. The Ce 0.95 Ru 0.05 O 2 and gold-grafted Ce 0.95 Ru 0.05 O 2 catalysts were synthesized via co-precipitation followed by hydrothermal crystalliza- tion and calcination 64,65 . In the co-precipitation procedure, CeCl 3 ·7H 2 O (3.8 mmol), RuCl 3 ·nH 2 O (0.2 mmol) and HAuCl 4 ·nH 2 O (x mmol, x = 0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 or 0.6) were dissolved in deionized water (10 ml) and then added dropwise to a 7 mol l −1 NaOH solution (70 ml) under vigorous stirring to form black precipitate. After ageing for 30 min, the mixture was sealed in a 100 ml polytetrafluoroethylene-lined autoclave and hydrothermally treated at 140 °C for 48 h. Subsequently, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed several times with water and isopropanol, dried at room temperature under vacuum and ground into a fine powder. Finally, the as-synthesized catalyst was obtained by calcination of the powder under air at 400 °C for 4 h. The gold-loaded samples were denoted as Au m /Ce 0.95 Ru 0.05 O 2 (m = 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.125 or 0.15). The reference CeO 2 and Au 0.1 /CeO 2 samples were synthesized following a similar procedure. The preparation of thin catalyst layers by a screen-printing method is described in Sup- plementary Note 5.
