Materials synthesis. Pb 1 Cu SAA catalyst. First, the Cu–Pb precursor was synthesized using an epoxide gelation approach. First, 515 mg CuCl 2 ·2H 2 O and 115 mg Pb(NO 3 ) 2 were dissolved in 2 ml isopropanol in a vial. Under bath sonication, 2 ml propylene oxide and 0.2 ml H 2 O were then successively added, forming a green gel. The green gel was aged for 1 day and dried at 60 °C under vacuum overnight. The Pb 1 Cu SAA catalyst was then formed in situ by reducing the Cu–Pb precursor at a constant current density of −500 mA cm−2 for 30 min in a standard three-electrode flow cell system supplied with CO 2 gas, with 0.5 M KHCO 3 as electrolyte.

Cu, Pb and Pb@Cu particles. Cu and Pb nanoparticles were synthesized in an approach similar to that used for the Pb 1 Cu SAA catalyst, except that 515 mg CuCl 2 ·2H 2 O or 500 mg Pb(NO 3 ) 2 , respectively, was used. To synthesize the Pb@Cu particles, 5 ml of a 10 mM Pb(NO 3 ) 2 solution was added to a suspension of 50 mg Cu nanoparticles in 15 ml of H 2 O with constant stirring, followed by the dropwise addition of a 50 mM NaBH 4 solution. This reaction was conducted for 1 h.

Bi 1 Cu and In 1 Cu SAAs. Bi 1 Cu and In 1 Cu SAAs were synthesized in a similar approach to that used for the Pb 1 Cu SAA, except that Pb(NO 3 ) 2 was replaced with 170 mg Bi(NO 3 ) 3 ·5H 2 O or 96 mg In(NO 3 ) 3 ·5H 2 O, respectively.
