Methods Catalyst preparation. A solution of Zn(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O (5.58 g) in 150 ml methanol was added to a solution of 2-methylimidazole (6.16 g) in 150 ml methanol. After stirring at room temperature for 24 h, the obtained ZIF-8 precipitates were collected by centrifugation and dried in vacuum at 80 °C. Subsequently, the obtained ZIF-8 (600 mg) powder was dispersed in 100 ml methanol to which was added a methanol solution of iridium(iv) chloride (1 mg ml−1, 7.08 ml). To this iridium-containing solution was added a mixture of 4,4′-sulfonyldiphenol (800 mg) and phosphonitrilic chloride trimer (375 mg) in 250 ml methanol. After vigorous stirring for 15 min, 3 ml triethylamine was added. The resulting mixture was stirred for 15 h, and the as-obtained ZIF-8/Ir@PZS precipitates were separated by centrifugation and dried in vacuum at 80 °C. The as-obtained ZIF-8/Ir@PZS was placed in a quartz boat and then maintained at 950 °C for 3 h in a tube furnace with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 under a flowing argon atmosphere. After allowing it to cool to room temperature, the as-prepared sample of Ir-SA was collected and used without further treatment.
