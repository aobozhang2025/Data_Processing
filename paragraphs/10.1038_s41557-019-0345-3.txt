Methods Catalyst preparation. The Au 1 –O x –Na 9 –(OH) y /TiO 2 catalysts were made by IWI of a solution prepared as detailed below. Gold loadings of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 wt% were prepared by a single-step IWI of the designed amount of the gold solution. To prepare the solution, the proper amount of Au(OH) 3 powder was suspended in 30 ml of H 2 O with O 2 sparging and heated to 80 °C. NaOH powder (atomic ratio of Au:Na = 1:9) was added into the slurry at the same temperature. The mixture was refluxed at 80 °C overnight to obtain a transparent solution (colourless at lower concentrations to light yellow at higher concentrations). The Au 1 –O x –Na 9 –(OH) y / TiO 2 catalysts were prepared by IWI of the gold solution at RT in air. The solution was concentrated by heating followed by drying at 200 °C with N 2 protection, and then the sample was further dried in vacuum overnight at 80 °C.
