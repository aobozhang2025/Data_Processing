Methods Preparation of photocatalysts. Unless otherwise stated, the purities of all reagents for photocatalyst preparation and for photoelectrochemical measurements are above the analytical grade. The pristine PCN and PCN_Na15 were prepared according to the reported methods19. The Sb-SAPCs were prepared by a bottom-up method as follows: a certain amount of NaSbF 6 (HuNan HuaJing Powdery Material, 0.5 mmol, 1 mmol, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 mmol) was dissolved in 30 ml of ethanol under sonication for 60 min at 60 °C, followed by adding 4 g melamine (Wako Pure Chemical Industries). The solvent in the solution was removed by combination of rotatory evaporator and vacuum oven. The obtained white powder was transferred into a tube furnace. To ensure that oxygen was not present during thermal treatment, the tube furnace was first vacuumed to <1 torr before switching on the N 2 gas flow. This process was repeated three times, and then 50 ml min−1 N 2 gas flow was maintained for 30 min before heat treatment. During the synthesis process (including heating and cooling), the system was pressurized by N 2 flow so that oxygen could not influence the synthesis. The temperature of the furnace was increased from 25 °C to 560 °C at a ramp rate of 2 °C min−1 in N 2 atmosphere then kept at 560 °C for 4 h. After heat treatment, the furnace was cooled down naturally to 25 °C lasting for at least 8 h with continuous N 2 flowing.
