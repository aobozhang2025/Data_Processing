Methods Synthesis of catalysts. γ-Al 2 O 3 (1 g) was dispersed in 20 ml ethanol. A 1.25 ml dark brown solution of RuCl 3 (40 μmol ml–1) in water was then added dropwise to the dispersion. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 h, then centrifuged and redispersed in 30 ml H 2 O. NaOH (1 M) or NH 3 ·H 2 O (30%) was added dropwise to adjust the pH value to ~9–10. The mixture was kept stirring for another 20 h at room temperature. The mixture was then centrifuged and washed with 50 ml water and ethanol three times before dried under vacuum at 60 °C overnight. The as-obtained samples were denoted as Ru(Na)/Al 2 O 3 and Ru(H)/Al 2 O 3 , respectively (Ru(Na) and Ru(H)). The ruthenium contents were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS ×7,700) to be 0.45 wt% and 0.43 wt% in Ru(Na) and Ru(H), respectively. The sodium content was determined by XRF S8 Tiger. No reliable sodium signal was detected on Ru(H). For Ru(Na), the sodium content was 1.2 wt%, ~1.7 sodium ions per nm–2. Ru(OH) 3 was prepared by deposition of RuCl 3 in H 2 O and dried under vacuum at 80 °C overnight50.
