Synthesis of Pt/α-MoC catalysts. Pt was deposited onto α-MoC (100 m 2 g −1 ) using an incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) method. Before the loading of Pt precursor, the α-MoC substrate was reduced in 10% H 2 /nitrogen (N 2 ) (20 ml min −1 ) at 523 K for 60 min, which is expected to create more surface anchoring sites for Pt species compared with our previous reported method 19 . Appropriate amounts of H 2 PtCl 6 ·6H 2 O (Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in 200 μl deaerated deionized water. The Pt precursor solution was finely mixed with 50 mg α-MoC powder, followed by drying in a vacuum oven at 323 K. Before catalytic evalu- ation, the samples were mildly reduced at 623 K for 1 h under H 2 flow at a flow rate of 60 ml min −1 first. Then the stream was switched to 15% CH 4 /H 2 (100 ml min −1 ), and the temperature was increased at 5 K min −1 to 863 K and then held at this temperature for 2 h to reactivate the samples. The samples were then cooled to room temperature in 15% CH 4 /H 2 .

Synthesis of α-MoC. Ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate (AMT, (NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 ·4H 2 O) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Rea- gent. The grinded powder of AMT was calcined in the muffle oven to 773 K at a rate of 10 K min −1 to synthesize the precursor MoO 3 . Typi- cally, 1 g MoO 3 was loaded into the tubular quartz reactor and placed in a vertical furnace. The powder was heated to 973 K in ammonia (160 ml min −1 ; pre-purified gas) at a rate of 5 K min −1 and kept at 973 K for 2 h. After the sample was cooled to room temperature, the gas was switched to a methane (CH 4 )/H 2 mixture (150 ml min −1 ; 20/80 v/v) and the temperature was increased to 973 K at 5 K min −1 and held at 973 K for 2 h. Finally, the sample was passivated at room temperature using a 1% oxygen/Ar gas mixture.
