Methods Preparation of Bi (1/x) @Pt We used the chemical reduction method for Bi (1/x) @Pt synthesis. First, predetermined quantities of Pt/C (20 wt%, 500 mg), deionized water (250 ml) and nitric acid (10 M, 0.15 ml) were added to 600 ml of the beaker. The mixture solution was then vigorously stirred for 12 h. After- wards, Bi 3+ (100 mg) in Bi(NO 3 ) 3 ·5H 2 O and nitric acid (5 M, 50 ml) were added and then additionally stirred for 30 min in 600 ml of beaker. Here, 100 mg, 33.3 mg and 8.33 mg of Bi 3+ were added to the mixture solution to get Bi (1/1) @Pt, Bi (1/3) @Pt and Bi (1/18) @Pt, respectively. Next, potassium hydroxide (8 M, ~30 ml) was added to neutralize the mixture solution, and NaBH 4 (0.05 M, 50 ml) was slowly added dropwise to uniformly

Preparation of Bi (1/3) Pt We used the chemical reduction method for the Bi (1/x) Pt synthesis. First, predetermined quantities of carbon (Vulcan XC-72R, 400 mg), platinum 100 mg (as H 2 PtCl 6 ), deionized water (250 ml) and nitric acid (10 M, 0.15 ml) were added to 600 ml of the beaker. The mixture solution was then vigorously stirred for 12 h. Afterwards, 33.3 mg of Bi 3+ (as a Bi(NO 3 ) 3 ) was added and then additionally stirred for 30 min. Next, potassium hydroxide (8 M, ~30 ml) was added to neutralize the mixture solution, and NaBH 4 (0.05 M, 50 ml) was slowly added dropwise to uniformly reduce bismuth species on Pt/C. Finally, the product was fil- tered, washed with water several times and dried under vacuum at 25 °C.
