These chemicals were used without further purification.  Preparation of carbon substrate. Sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate (10 g) was dried in an oven at a temperature of 150 °C for 48 h. Then, the reaction temperature was decreased to room temperature, and a white powder was obtained and transferred into a porcelain boat and heated for 1 hour at a fixed temperature (800 °C) and a temperature ramp rate of 5 °C min−1 using Ar flow. The harvested black powder was treated with 5 M H2SO4 solution for 12 h at 80 °C, and several washing processes with ultrapure water and ethanol, as well as 6 h drying at 75 °C.  Preparation of NC. As-synthesized carbon substrate (100 mg) and dicyandiamide (1 g) were well mixed by grinding together and heated for 2 hours at 800 °C (temperature rate of 5 °C min−1) using gas flow of Ar. Then, NC was collected through a washing process using ultrapure water and ethanol and a 6 h drying process at a fixed temperature of 75 °C.  Preparation of Ni2NC and Ni1NC. First, nickel(II) acetate tetrahydrate (12.8 mg) and citric acid monohydrate (32.2 mg) were dissolved in 2 ml of ethanol and the solution kept at room temperature with stirring for 1 h. Subsequently, on adding the carbon substrate (100 mg) into the solution, the mixture was stirred continuously under ambient conditions for 6 h, and the resulting dispersion  changed to a black solid after 12 h drying at 75 °C. After grinding with dicyandiamide (1 g) in a mortar, the black solid was transferred into a porcelain boat. The black solid was heated for 2 h at 800 °C with a temperature rate of 5 °C min−1 with an Ar stream. Ni2NC was obtained after washing several times with 3 M HCl solution and ultrapure water, and then drying for 12 h at 80 °C. Ni1NC was obtained using a similar procedure, except that ammonia solution (50 μl) was added in the first step. To study the influence of pyrolysis temperature, the molar ratio of metal precursors and chelating agent (citric acid) and the amount of nitrogen source (dicyandiamide) on the morphology and the dispersion of dual metal atom on NC, more contrast samples were synthesized as follows: (1) the pyrolysis temperature was varied from 800 °C to 700 °C and 900 °C; (2) the ratio of metal precursors and chelating agents was changed from 1:3 to 1:2 and 1:4; and (3) the amount of dicyandiamide was changed from 1 g to 0.5 g and 1.5 g. Additionally, large-scale synthesis of Ni2NC was carried out with 20-fold higher amounts of precursors compared to the above synthesis procedure for Ni2NC.  Preparation of Mn2NC, Zn2NC and Pd2NC. Mn2NC, Zn2NC and Pd2NC were synthesized using a similar procedure to that used for fabricating Ni2NC. The amounts of the metal salt and citric acid monohydrate used in each synthesis were: manganese acetate (4.5 mg) and citric acid monohydrate (11.48 mg); zinc acetate dihydrate (3.4 mg) and citric acid monohydrate (9.64 mg); palladium chloride (1.67 mg) and citric acid monohydrate (5.92 mg).
