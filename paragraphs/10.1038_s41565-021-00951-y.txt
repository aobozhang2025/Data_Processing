Synthesis of g-C 3 N 4 support. Urea was placed in a crucible and heated to 600 °C for 4 h in static air at a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1. The resulting yellow material was milled into fine powders in a mortar. Next, the yellow powder was placed in an open ceramic container and heated at 550 °C for another 4 h. A light-yellow powder of g-C 3 N 4 support was finally obtained.

Synthesis of Cu 1 /g-C 3 N 4 catalysts. Cu ALD was carried out on a viscous-flow stainless steel tube reactor system (ACME (Beijing) Technology) at 300 °C using Cu(hfac) 2 and formaldehyde as the precursors. Ultrahigh-purity N 2 (99.999%) was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 60 ml min−1. The Cu(hfac) 2 precursor container was heated to 65 °C to reach a sufficient vapour pressure. The inlet manifold was held at 100 °C to avoid precursor condensation. The timing sequence was 300, 300, 40 and 180 s for Cu(hfac) 2 exposure, N 2 purge, formaldehyde exposure and N 2 purge, respectively. One, two, and ten cycles of Cu ALD were performed on g-C 3 N 4 to obtain Cu 1 (5.1%)/g-C 3 N 4 , Cu 1 (8.1%)/g-C 3 N 4 and Cu 1 (11.4%)/g-C 3 N 4 catalysts, respectively. When the Cu(hfac) 2 exposure time was reduced to 25 and 150 s for one cycle of Cu ALD on g-C 3 N 4 , Cu loadings of 0.5% and 2.7% were obtained, which were denoted as Cu 1 (0.5%)/g-C 3 N 4 and Cu 1 (2.7%)/g-C 3 N 4 , respectively.

Synthesis of Ni 1 /g-C 3 N 4 and Ni 1 Cu 2 /g-C 3 N 4 catalysts. NiO x ALD was carried out on the g-C 3 N 4 support at 240 °C using NiCp 2 and ozone as the precursors. The NiCp 2 precursor container was heated to 90 °C to achieve a sufficient vapour pressure. The inlet manifold was held at 115 °C to avoid precursor condensation on the inner walls. The timing sequence was 1,260, 200, 1,260 and 200 s for NiCp 2 exposure, N 2 purge, O 3 exposure and N 2 purge, respectively. Different NiCp 2 exposure times (from 100 to 1,260 s) were used on g-C 3 N 4 to obtain a series of Ni single-atom catalysts with different Ni loadings (denoted as Ni 1 (x%)/g-C 3 N 4 , where x is the Ni loading). NiO x ALD was also carried on the Cu 1 (8.1%)/g-C 3 N 4 samples with different NiCp 2 exposure times (from 200 to 1,260 s). The resulting samples were denoted as Ni 1 (x%)Cu 1 (8.1%)/g-C 3 N 4 (the optimized sample, namely, Ni 1 (3.1%)Cu 1 (8.1%)/g-C 3 N 4 , was denoted as Ni 1 Cu 2 /g-C 3 N 4 ).
