Methods Catalyst preparation A series of xFe–yMn catalysts, with different Fe/Mn molar ratios, was prepared via the co-precipitation method using iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO 3 ) 3 ·9H 2 O) and manganese(II) nitrate tetrahy- drate (Mn(NO 3 ) 2 ·4H 2 O) as the metal precursors. Typically, appropri- ate amounts of Fe(NO 3 ) 3 ·9H 2 O and Mn(NO 3 ) 2 ·4H 2 O were dissolved in deionized water (180 ml) for a total molar concentration of Fe 3+ and Mn 2+ of 0.56 mol l −1 . Each mass of Fe(NO 3 ) 3 ·9H 2 O and Mn(NO 3 ) 2 ·4H 2 O was determined by the molar ratio of Fe to Mn (9.9:0.1, 9.5:0.5, 9:1, 7:3 and 5:5). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. Then, ammonia solution (NH 4 OH; Roth, 25% NH 3 in H 2 O) was added dropwise into the above solution under stirring until the pH value reached 9.5. The suspension was aged for 3 h, filtered and washed until a neutral pH value was achieved. The obtained samples were dried at 100 °C overnight and calcined at 400 °C with a heating rate of 3 °C min −1 for 6 h. They were named xFe–yMn, where x:y stands for the molar ratio of Fe to Mn. The catalyst without Mn was also prepared using only Fe(NO 3 ) 3 ꞏ9H 2 O while other preparation conditions were kept the same.
