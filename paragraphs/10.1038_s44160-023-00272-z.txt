Methods Synthesis of CNIO-GaSA x (x = 1, 2, 3) First, 800 mg of dicyandiamide was mixed with 500 μl of gallium nitrate aqueous solution of different concentrations (1.6, 3.2 and 8 g l –1 , for CNIO-GaSA 1 , CNIO-GaSA 2 and CNIO-GaSA 3 , respectively), and ground evenly until the solution was nearly dry. Then, the mixture was freeze-dried for 12 h. Afterwards, the product ( ∼ 0.8 g) was mixed with silica templates (1.33 g), and calcined in argon at 520 °C with a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1 for 2 h. The product was further heated to 550 °C with a ramp rate of 5 °C min −1 and kept at 550 °C for another 2 h. The as-obtained product was etched in NH4HF2 aqueous solution for 72 h to remove the silica template completely, before being washed with deionized water three times and dried under ambient conditions.
