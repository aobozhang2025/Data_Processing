Methods Catalyst preparation For the synthesis of y mol% MO x /Ni catalysts, a two-step co-precipitation method was employed. The synthetic methods for y mol% MO x /Ni cata- lysts (y = 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90) are the same. The synthesis of 90 mol% CeZrO x /Ni catalyst (10 mol% Ni/CeZrO x ) is taken as an example: a solu- tion of Zr(NO 3 ) 2 ·5H 2 O and Ce(NO 3 ) 3 ·6H 2 O was dispersed in 50 ml of ethanol using ultrasonic. Then, the oxalic acid ethanol solution (0.5 M) was added dropwise to the vigorously stirred mixed solution. The result- ing Zr(C 2 O 4 ) 2 and Ce 2 (C 2 O 4 ) 3 solids were separated by centrifugation and then dispersed in ethanol solution (solution I). Subsequently, Ni (NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O and oxalic acid ethanol solution were simultaneous added dropwise into solution I. After 3 h of reaction, the resulting solid was separated by centrifugation and dried at 60 °C overnight. The synthetic methods for y mol% MO x /Ni catalysts (y = 3, 7, 9, 13, 20 and 40) are the same. The synthesis procedure of 13 mol% CeZrO x / Ni catalyst is taken as an example. First, Ni (NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O was dissolved in 50 ml of ethanol. Then, oxalic acid ethanol solution (0.5 M) was added dropwise to the vigorously stirred mixed solution. The resulting NiC 2 O 4 solid was separated by centrifugation and dispersed in ethanol solution (solution II). Subsequently, a simultaneous dropwise addition of Zr(NO 3 ) 2 ·5H 2 O, Ce(NO 3 )3·6H 2 O and oxalic acid ethanol solution was carried out into solution II. After 3 h of reaction, the resulting solids were separated by centrifugation and dried at 60 °C for 12 h (refs. 25,28). The dried powder was calcined in a furnace at 400 °C for 3 h (ref. 27). The loadings of Ce, Zr and Ni were determined by ICP opti- cal emission spectrometry (OES).
