Preparation of CoCZ by strong electrostatic adsorption A series of CZ-based catalysts with different metal loadings were prepared using a wet impregnation method 14 . For this purpose, the desired amount of cobalt acetate was dissolved in 50 ml of deionized water. The suspension obtained by the addition of 2 g of nanocrys- talline CZ was stirred for 2 h, followed by removal of water by evap- oration. Catalysts were dried at 110 °C in air overnight and then calcined at 350 °C for 4 h. Before catalytic activity tests, catalysts were reduced at 225–500 °C in H 2 for 4 h. Catalysts reduced at differ- ent temperatures are denoted as xCoy, where x is Co loading and y reduction temperature.

Sol-gel synthesis of single-atom CoCZ To obtain a solid solution of CoCZ (Co-doped CZ solid solution), a synthesis procedure reported by Yuan et al. 42 was modified. In a typical synthesis, 0.8 g of Pluronic P123 (Sigma-Aldrich) and the desired ratio of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 ⋅ 6H 2 O (Sigma-Aldrich), ZrOCl 2 ⋅ 8H 2 O (Sigma-Aldrich) and Co(NO 3 ) 2 ⋅ 6H 2 O (total amount of Co, Ce and Zr was 5 mmol) were added to 16 ml of ethanol. After stirring for at least 2 h at room temperature, the homogeneous sol was transferred to an oven at 40 °C. After 48 h of ageing, the gel product was dried at 100 °C for 24 h. Calcination was carried out in air by slowly increasing the temperature from room temperature to 500 °C at a rate of 1 °C min −1 , followed by a dwell of 4 h at 500 °C.

Cobalt nanoparticles supported on SiO 2 Small cobalt nanoparticles were synthesized using wetness impreg- nation with a cobalt (tris)ethyleneamine precursor. Catalysts were dried at 110 °C in air overnight and then pyrolysed in a helium flow at 350 °C for 4 h. Before catalytic activity tests, catalysts were reduced at 300–500 °C in H 2 for 4 h.
