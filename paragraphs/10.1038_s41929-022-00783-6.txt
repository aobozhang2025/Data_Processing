Synthesis of Aza-CMP. A total of 532.5 mg (1.875 mmol) of 1,2,4,5-benzenetetramine tetrahydrochloride in 15 ml of anhydrous DMF and 390 mg (1.25 mmol) of hexaketocyclohexane octahydrate in 5 ml of anhydrous DMF were mixed and refluxed for 48 h under Ar. The resulting dark-brown solid was purified via hot extraction with methanol for 48 h using a Soxhlet extractor, then dried under vacuum at 150 °C for 24 h. Protonation-assisted exfoliation of the as-prepared bulk polymer was performed according to the reported literature18. To summarize, Aza-CMP (100 mg) was dispersed in 100 ml of 12 M HCl, and the suspension was subjected to ultrasonication for 24 h. The mixture was diluted with deionized water and centrifuged at 2,000 r.p.m. for 10 min to separate large aggregates. Exfoliated nanosheets were collected by filter (polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), 45 μm) and washed thoroughly with water.

Synthesis of Aza-CMP-Co. Aza-CMP material was modified with Co2+ using cobalt(II) acetate. Aza-CMP (20 mg) was immersed in 10 ml of anhydrous DMF and the suspension stirred for 1 h under an Ar atmosphere, with the gas bubbling through the solution. Next, 85 mg (1.5 eq. with respect to phenanthroline units) of cobalt(II) acetate was dissolved in 10 ml of anhydrous DMF under Ar. The Co solution was slowly added to the suspension under Ar, and the mixture was maintained in a dispersed state by ultrasonication for 8 h at room temperature. The solid was filtered and then washed with DMF, water, methanol and ethanol until the filtrate became colourless. Finally, the product was dried at 80 °C under vacuum conditions. Aza-CMP-Co (exfoliated) was fabricated via the same procedure while replacing the as-prepared bulk Aza-CMP with exfoliated Aza-CMP.
