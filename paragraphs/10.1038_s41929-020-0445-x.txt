Synthesis and characterization. Following the promising compu­ tational results, we synthesized ultralow­loading Pt­doped TiO 2 nanoparticles. At 0.04 wt%, Pt single atoms, dimers, trimers and some small clusters are dominant (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9). By contrast, Pt nanoparticles (>0.5 nm) are only occasion­ ally seen. Increasing the Pt loading to 1 wt% makes Pt nanoparticles prevalent (Fig. 2b) due to aggregation of Pt during synthesis and pre­treatment. Figure 2c shows the k2­weighted extended in situ X­ray absorp­ tion fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of two reduced Pt/TiO 2 cata­ lysts and Pt standards. The scattering from the nearest­neighbour Pt atoms in the Pt foil gives rise to two peaks at 2.3 and 2.9 Å, whereas the scattering from the first­shell O atoms leads to the peak at below 2 Å owing to the shorter Pt–O bond distance in α­PtO 2 . In addi­ tion to the first shell, the EXAFS spectrum of α­PtO 2 shows two additional peaks at 2.7 and 3.3 Å, which can be assigned to the near­ est Pt and the second­shell O. The spectra of Pt/TiO 2 samples were collected after reducing the catalysts in situ at 250 °C, to ensure that all PtO x nanoparticles were reduced. The peak at 1.86 Å (Fig. 2c) is assigned to the bonds between Pt atoms and the TiO 2 surface. The decreasing peak upon reduction (Supplementary Fig. 10) suggests that the Pt–O coordination contributes at least partially to the peak. For the lowest loading, the absence of the first­shell Pt–Pt contri­ bution and the second­shell Pt–O contribution at >2.3 Å in the R space of the spectrum further confirms the absence of Pt nanopar­ ticles. The X­ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 11; Pt L 3 edge) shows an intense white­line peak, suggesting that the highly dispersed Pt is cationic. This was also supported by XPS findings that the Pt remains in the oxidized state at 1.5 torr H 2 and 250 °C (Supplementary Fig.13). Infrared (IR) spectroscopy of CO on supported metal catalysts has been used widely to identify specific surface metal sites27. Here we show that Fourier­transform IR spectroscopy (FTIR) with CO as a probe molecule can differentiate Pt single atoms and nanoparticles. The FTIR spectra of adsorbed CO on Pt/TiO 2 with different loadings exhibit two CO adsorption (on Pt) bands centred at 2,118 cm−1 and 2,060 to 2,089 cm−1, as shown in Fig. 2d. The peak at 2,118 cm−1 is assigned to CO adsorbed on isolated Ptδ+ atoms, according to pre­ vious works27,28. The bands below 2,100 cm−1 are assigned to CO adsorbed on well­coordinated (~2,080 cm−1) and under­coordinated

Catalyst synthesis. For the synthesis, 2 g of anatase TiO 2 (5 nm nanoparticles from US Research Nanomaterials, stock no. US3838) was suspended in 200 ml aqueous solution at a pH of 2 (buffered by 1 M HCl). Then 100 ml H 2 PtCl 6 aqueous solution (pH of 2) was slowly added into the suspended TiO 2 solution. After 1 h of ageing and filtration, the solid paste was dried in a vacuum furnace at room temperature overnight and further dried in an air oven at 110 °C overnight. The catalyst was further calcined in a quartz tubular reactor at 250 °C with flowing air, and then reduced at 250 °C with 10% H 2 –He mixture.
