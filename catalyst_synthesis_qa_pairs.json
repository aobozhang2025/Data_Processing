This is part of a broader family of catalysts denoted as **\"M₁/CN\"**, where M can be Ir, Pt, Pd, Ru, Mo, Ga, Cu, Ni, or Mn (single atoms of these metals on N-doped carbon).\n\nThe synthesis is a **two-step process**:\n1.  **Formation of a Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) Composite Precursor (Metal(acac)₃@ZIF-8)**.\n2.  **Controlled Pyrolysis (Calcination) of the precursor** under inert gas to carbonize the MOF and atomically disperse the metal.\n\n**Detailed Synthesis Procedure for Ir₁/CN:**\n\nTwo specific methods are described for the Ir precursor:\n\n*   **Method 1 (Hydrothermal):**\n    1.  Dissolve Zn(NO₃)₂·6H₂O (0.594 g, 2 mmol) and Ir(acac)₃ (97.9 mg, 0.20 mmol) simultaneously in 7.5 ml methanol to form a clear solution.\n    2.

Transfer the mixture to a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave.\n    5.  Seal the autoclave and heat at 120 °C for 4 hours.\n    6.  Cool the autoclave to room temperature.\n    7.  Collect the resulting solid (**Ir(acac)₃@ZIF-8 nanocrystals**) by centrifugation.\n    8.  Wash the solid four times with methanol.\n    9.  Dry the washed solid under vacuum overnight.\n\n*   **Method 2 (Room Temperature Aging):**\n    1.  Dissolve Zn(NO₃)₂·6H₂O (1.069 g, 3.6 mmol) and Ir(acac)₃ (176 mg, 0.36 mmol) simultaneously in 15 ml methanol to form a clear solution.\n    2.

Cool the sample down to room temperature.\n5.  **Repeat this calcination procedure two more times** (for a total of three identical calcination cycles).\n6.  The resulting black powder after the third calcination and cooling is the catalyst **Ir₁/CN**.\n\n**Generalization to M₁/CN (M = Pt, Pd, Ru, Mo, Ga, Cu, Ni, Mn):**\nThe procedure is analogous to Ir₁/CN, using the respective metal acetylacetonate precursor. Key variations include:\n1.  **Precursor Synthesis:**\n    *   **For Pt, Pd, Ru, Cu, Ni, Mn:**\n        *   Dissolve Zn(NO₃)₂·6H₂O (1.069 g, 3.6 mmol) and Metal(acac)ₓ (0.22-0.36 mmol, see Supplementary Table 3) in 15 ml methanol (30 ml for Pd) at 30-55 °C.\n        *   Add this to 10 ml methanol containing 2-methylimidazole (1.161 g, 14.2 mmol).\n        *   Stir vigorously for 5 min.\n        *   Age at room temperature without stirring for 20 h.\n    *   **For Ga, Mo:**\n        *   Dissolve Zn(NO₃)₂·6H₂O (0.594 g, 2 mmol) and Metal(acac)ₓ (0.10-0.12 mmol, see Supplementary Table 3) in 7.5 ml methanol at 30-55 °C.\n        *   Add this to 15 ml methanol containing 2-methylimidazole (0.656 g, 8 mmol).\n        *   Stir vigorously for 5 min.\n        *   Transfer to autoclave, heat at 120 °C for 4 h, cool to RT.\n    *   Collect solid (**Metal(acac)ₓ@ZIF-8**) by centrifugation, wash 4x with methanol, dry under vacuum overnight.\n2.  **Pyrolysis:**\n    *   Place **Metal(acac)ₓ@ZIF-8** powder in tube furnace.\n    *   Heat to **800 °C or 900 °C** (specific temperature depends on M, text mentions both) at 5 °C/min under Ar (200 ml/min).\n    *   Hold for 3 hours.\n    *   Cool to room temperature to obtain **M₁/CN**.
