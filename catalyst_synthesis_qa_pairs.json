        "output": "Based on the provided text, here's a professional chemist's summary of the synthesized catalyst and its detailed synthesis procedures:\n\n**Synthesized Catalyst:**\n*   **Name:** Isolated Cobalt Atom-Promoted Sulfur-Deficient Single-Layer Molybdenum Disulfide\n*   **Notation:** Co–S MoS₂\n*   **Key Feature:** Single cobalt (Co) atoms anchored onto sulfur vacancy sites within a single-layer MoS₂ support that is inherently sulfur-deficient (denoted S MoS₂).\n*   **Purpose:** The sulfur vacancies in S MoS₂ act as high-affinity anchoring sites for the Co atoms, facilitated by a thiourea complex, preventing Co nanoparticle formation and creating atomically dispersed Co catalysts.\n\n**Detailed Synthesis Procedures:**\n\n1.  **Preparation of Single-Layer Sulfur-Deficient MoS₂ Support (S MoS₂):** *(Prerequisite for Catalyst)*\n    *   **Lithium Intercalation:** 0.5 g bulk crystalline MoS₂ powder is soaked in 4 ml of 1.6 M n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) in hexane under N₂ atmosphere for 48 hours. This forms lithium-intercalated MoS₂ (LiₓMoS₂).\n    *   **Washing:** LiₓMoS₂ is washed via vacuum filtration using 50 ml hexane to remove excess n-BuLi and organics. It is then dried under N₂.\n    *   **Exfoliation:** The dried LiₓMoS₂ powder is immersed in 250 ml water. The suspension is sonicated to complete exfoliation. Intercalated lithium reacts with water, generating H₂ gas between layers, forcing them apart.\n    *   **Centrifugation:** The dispersion is centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 15 minutes. Un-exfoliated material forms a pellet.\n    *   **Collection of Supernatant:** The supernatant (containing exfoliated single-layer S MoS₂) is collected by pipette. The dispersion is alkaline (pH >7) due to trace LiOH.\n    *   **Neutralization & Collection:** HCl solution is added dropwise to the colloid until pH ≈ 7. This causes the S MoS₂ to precipitate.\n    *   **Washing & Drying:** The precipitate is washed several times via centrifugation, collected, and dried under vacuum for 12 hours. *This yields the S MoS₂ support powder.*\n\n2.  **Preparation of Co–S MoS₂ Catalyst:**\n    *   **Formation of Co-Thiourea Complex:** 50.6 mg cobalt acetate tetrahydrate [Co(CH₃COO)₂·4H₂O] and 36 mg thiourea [SC(NH₂)₂] are added to 1 ml water. This mixture is left overnight to form the [Co(thiourea)₄]²⁺ complex.\n    *   **Preparation of S MoS₂ Colloid:** A stabilized colloid is prepared by dispersing 50 mg of the *previously synthesized S MoS₂ powder* in 50 ml of a solvent mixture (30 v/v% isopropanol in water) containing 50 mg polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Concentration = 1 mg S MoS₂ per ml.\n    *   **Mixing:** The entire [Co(thiourea)₄]²⁺ complex solution (from step 1) is added to the 50 ml S MoS₂ colloid and mixed to form a homogeneous solution. *Note the low Co concentration to prevent self-nucleation.*\n    *   **Hydrothermal Anchoring:** The homogeneous mixture is transferred to an autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 24 hours. During this step:\n        *   Thiourea ligands coordinate with sulfur vacancy sites on the S MoS₂.\n        *   Cobalt atoms from the complex are delivered and anchored onto these vacancy sites.\n    *   **Workup:** After reaction, the solid product is:\n        *   Washed three times with deionized water.\n        *   Dried under vacuum for 12 hours.\n    *   **Activation:** The dried powder is treated with H₂ gas at 300 °C for 1 hour prior to storage/use. *(Likely reduces surface species and stabilizes the Co sites)*.\n\n3.  **Preparation of F MoS₂ (Supplementary Information):**\n    *   **Dispersion & Exfoliation:** 6 g bulk MoS₂ powder is dispersed in 400 ml solvent (30 v/v% isopropanol in water) with 4 ml hydrazine monohydrate (N₂H₄·H₂O).\n    *   **Sonication:** The mixture is sonicated for 12 hours to exfoliate the MoS₂.\n    *   **Centrifugation:** Centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 60 min to remove un-exfoliated sediment.\n    *   **Neutralization & Flocculation:** HCl solution is added to the supernatant (colloid) until pH ≈ 7. This disrupts charge balance, causing rapid flocculation (precipitation) of the exfoliated F MoS₂.\n    *   **Washing & Drying:** The precipitate is centrifuged, washed three times with deionized water, and dried under vacuum for 12 hours.\n\n**Key Rationale Highlighted in Synthesis:**\n*   The **very low concentration of the Co-thiourea complex** is critical to ensure Co atoms anchor directly onto S MoS₂ sulfur vacancies instead of forming separate Co or CoSₓ nanoparticles (self-nucleation).\n*   The **thiourea ligands** in the complex specifically target the **sulfur vacancy sites** on the S MoS₂ support due to the high affinity of these defects for thiol-based molecules.\n*   The **hydrothermal treatment** provides the energy and environment necessary for the complex to react with and fill the vacancies, anchoring the Co atoms."

The preference for \"extra dry solvents sealed under N₂\" further emphasizes strict moisture and oxygen exclusion.\n*   **Drying Conditions:** Elevated temperature (5-10°C above solvent BP) under inert gas ensures complete solvent removal and likely facilitates precursor decomposition/precursor-support interaction without excessive sintering.\n*   **Metal Loading:** Explicitly stated as 1 wt.% for Au/C. Loading for Ru/C, Pt/C, Pd/C is not specified but follows the *same procedure*, implying the precursor mass was calculated for a specific target loading (likely also 1 wt.% or a comparable value).\n*   **Precursor Specificity:** Precursors are chosen based on metal solubility and stability in organic solvents suitable for wet impregnation on carbon (chloride for Au, acetylacetonates for Ru, Pd, Pt).\n\nThis procedure results in dried catalyst precursors supported on activated carbon.

The resulting black powder after the third calcination and cooling is the catalyst **Ir₁/CN**.\n\n**Generalization to M₁/CN (M = Pt, Pd, Ru, Mo, Ga, Cu, Ni, Mn):**\nThe procedure is analogous to Ir₁/CN, using the respective metal acetylacetonate precursor. Key variations include:\n1.  **Precursor Synthesis:**\n    *   **For Pt, Pd, Ru, Cu, Ni, Mn:**\n        *   Dissolve Zn(NO₃)₂·6H₂O (1.069 g, 3.6 mmol) and Metal(acac)ₓ (0.22-0.36 mmol, see Supplementary Table 3) in 15 ml methanol (30 ml for Pd) at 30-55 °C.\n        *   Add this to 10 ml methanol containing 2-methylimidazole (1.161 g, 14.2 mmol).\n        *   Stir vigorously for 5 min.\n        *   Age at room temperature without stirring for 20 h.\n    *   **For Ga, Mo:**\n        *   Dissolve Zn(NO₃)₂·6H₂O (0.594 g, 2 mmol) and Metal(acac)ₓ (0.10-0.12 mmol, see Supplementary Table 3) in 7.5 ml methanol at 30-55 °C.\n        *   Add this to 15 ml methanol containing 2-methylimidazole (0.656 g, 8 mmol).\n        *   Stir vigorously for 5 min.\n        *   Transfer to autoclave, heat at 120 °C for 4 h, cool to RT.\n    *   Collect solid (**Metal(acac)ₓ@ZIF-8**) by centrifugation, wash 4x with methanol, dry under vacuum overnight.\n2.  **Pyrolysis:**\n    *   Place **Metal(acac)ₓ@ZIF-8** powder in tube furnace.\n    *   Heat to **800 °C or 900 °C** (specific temperature depends on M, text mentions both) at 5 °C/min under Ar (200 ml/min).\n    *   Hold for 3 hours.\n    *   Cool to room temperature to obtain **M₁/CN**. (Note: The text does not specify multiple calcination cycles for other metals like it did for Ir, implying a single calcination might be sufficient).\n\n**Key Synthesis Principles:**\n*   **Precursor:** ZIF-8 (formed *in-situ* from Zn²⁺ and 2-methylimidazole) acts as a host matrix, trapping the metal acetylacetonate complex.\n*   **Pyrolysis:** High-temperature treatment under inert gas (Ar) carbonizes the organic ZIF-8 framework into N-doped carbon (CN) while decomposing the metal complex. The confinement within the MOF pores promotes the formation of isolated single metal atoms (M₁) anchored to the CN support.\n*   **Multiple Calcination (Ir):** The triple calcination for Ir is likely crucial for complete removal of ligands/contaminants and achieving optimal dispersion/stability of the single Ir atoms.\n\nThe catalyst is thus **atomically dispersed iridium (or other metals) on a nitrogen-doped carbon support**, synthesized via **MOF encapsulation followed by controlled pyrolysis**."

(Ni–N–C-1.5 & Ni–N–C-3 from GQDs–OH verified by STEM).\n\n**Key Observations:**\n*   The core synthesis strategy involves adsorbing the metal precursor (IrCl₃, H₂PtCl₆, Ni(NO₃)₂) onto a nitrogen-functionalized carbon support (GQDs–NH₂, GQDs–OH, GO–NH₂), followed by freeze-drying, mixing with excess urea, and high-temperature pyrolysis under inert gas (Ar).\n*   Pyrolysis temperature is critical: 500°C for Ir/Pt catalysts, 750°C for Ni catalysts.\n*   Urea serves as an additional nitrogen source during pyrolysis, promoting N-doping and potentially aiding in the formation of M-Nₓ sites.\n*   Nominal metal loading is controlled by the volume of metal stock solution added relative to a fixed mass of carbon support.\n*   The choice of support (GQDs–NH₂ vs GQDs–OH vs GO–NH₂) and its functionalization significantly impacts the catalyst properties and intended application (e.g., avoiding heavy N-doping for CO₂RR by using GQDs–OH)."

Synthesis of Pt₁/OLC (Pt Single Atoms on Onion-Like Carbon)**\n    *   **Support Preparation (OLC from DND):**\n        1.  **Starting Material:** Pristine Detonation Nanodiamonds (DND) powder (Henan Union Abrasive Co. Ltd).\n        2.  **Oxidation:** 1 g DND added to 100 ml mixture of H₂SO₄/HNO₃ (3:1 v/v). Refluxed at 160 °C for 24 hours. Purpose: Remove amorphous carbon and graft oxygen functional groups.\n        3.  **Washing:** Cooled mixture washed with deionized water multiple times until pH = 7 is reached.\n        4.  **Thermal Annealing (Deoxygenation & Transformation):** The oxidized DND is thermally annealed at various temperatures.\n            *   Purpose: Precisely tune the type and density of oxygen species. Critical for stabilizing Pt atoms.\n            *   Transformation: At elevated temperatures (>900 °C), the DND automatically transforms into Onion-Like Carbon (OLC) (confirmed by characterization).

The exact timing sequence is referenced as being the same as that used for Pt₁/graphene (though not detailed here).\n        2.  **Result:** Isolated Pt atoms dispersed on the OLC support (confirmed by HAADF-STEM), named Pt₁/OLC.\n\n**2.

Transformation and surface tuning occur via controlled thermal annealing of oxidized DND.\n    *   **Pt₁/graphene:** Uses Hummers-method derived GO, which is then reduced via high-temperature annealing.\n*   **Confirmation:** The atomic dispersion of Pt on OLC (Pt₁/OLC) was confirmed by HAADF-STEM imaging, showing isolated atoms without nanoparticles or clusters.\n\n**In summary:** The catalysts synthesized are **Platinum Single Atoms on Onion-Like Carbon (Pt₁/OLC)** and **Platinum Single Atoms on Graphene (Pt₁/graphene)**. Both involve precise engineering of the carbon support surface (via oxidation and controlled thermal annealing) followed by deposition of isolated Pt atoms using precisely **one cycle of Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD)**."

        "output": "Based on the provided text, here's a professional chemist's summary of the synthesized catalyst and its detailed synthesis procedure:\n\n**1. Catalyst Synthesized:**\n*   **Name:** Ti₁–rGO SAM (Single-Atom Titanium on Reduced Graphene Oxide)\n*   **Nature:** A single-atom catalyst (SAM = Single-Atom Material) where individual Titanium (Ti) atoms are anchored onto the surface of Reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO).\n*   **Precursor:** Titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (Organic Ti salt).\n\n**2. Detailed Synthesis Procedure for Ti₁–rGO SAM:**\n\n1.  **Dispersion:** 400 mg of graphite oxide (GO) is dispersed in 120 ml of isopropanol (IPA).\n2.  **Ti Precursor Addition:** 20 µl of the organic Ti salt (titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate)) is added to the GO/IPA dispersion under continuous magnetic stirring.\n3.  **Mixing & Chemisorption:**\n    *   The mixture is subjected to **ultrasonic dispersion for 1 hour**.\n    *   Followed by **continuous magnetic stirring for 20 hours**. (This extended period allows for the chemisorption of Ti species onto the GO surface).\n4.  **Separation:** The dispersion is centrifuged to separate the solid material.\n5.  **Drying:** The resulting precipitate (solid) is dried under vacuum at **85 °C for 24 hours**.\n6.  **Calcination/Reduction:** The dried powder is calcined at **550 °C for 2 hours** under a **high-purity N₂ atmosphere**. This step simultaneously:\n    *   Reduces GO to rGO.\n    *   Decomposes the organic ligands from the Ti precursor.\n    *   Stabilizes the single Ti atoms onto the rGO support.\n7.  **Product:** After cooling to room temperature, a **fluffy black powder** is obtained, identified as the Ti₁–rGO SAM catalyst.\n\n**3. Control Material Synthesis (rGO):**\n*   The procedure for synthesizing pure Reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO) is identical to steps 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 described above for Ti₁–rGO SAM.\n*   The **critical difference** is that **no organic Ti salt is added** in step 2. Only graphite oxide is dispersed in IPA and processed through the same mixing, separation, drying, and calcination steps.\n\n**Key Points from a Catalyst Synthesis Perspective:**\n\n*   **Mechanism:** The synthesis relies on a **chemisorption route**, where the Ti precursor coordinates/reacts with functional groups on the GO surface during the extended stirring period.\n*   **Single-Atom Formation:** The low concentration of Ti precursor (20 µl per 400 mg GO) combined with the chemisorption step and the stabilizing nature of the rGO support during high-temperature calcination under inert gas (N₂) promotes the formation of isolated, single Ti atoms rather than nanoparticles or clusters.\n*   **Reduction/Activation:** The high-temperature (550°C) calcination in N₂ is essential for reducing GO to conductive rGO and removing organic residues from the Ti precursor, activating the Ti sites.\n*   **Control:** Synthesizing rGO via the exact same procedure (minus Ti) provides a crucial control material to isolate the effect of the single Ti atoms in subsequent applications (like the described perovskite solar cells).\n\n**Note:** The text also details the synthesis of other materials (c-TiO₂, mp-TiO₂, SnO₂, Perovskites, Spiro-OMeTAD) and the fabrication of solar cell architectures. However, based on your request, this summary focuses *exclusively* on the synthesis of the catalyst (Ti₁–rGO SAM) and its control material (rGO)."

It mimics the effect of direct NH₃ gas treatments but utilizes the solid NH₄Cl precursor.\n    *   **Final Product:** The resulting catalyst is denoted the **Fe-AC catalyst**.\n\n**Key Synthesis Innovations Highlighted:**\n1.  **Precursor Design:** Encapsulating ultra-fine Fe₂O₃ nanoparticles within ZIF-8 enables controlled release and capture of Fe to maximize FeN₄ site density during pyrolysis.\n2.  **Secondary Activation:** Using solid NH₄Cl as a sacrificial templating/etching agent during high-temperature pyrolysis (1100°C) introduces micropores and defects to enhance accessibility and activity.

(Note: This basic pH is crucial for controlling Pt deposition and dispersion).\n\n    2.  **Support Suspension:**\n        *   Prepare an aqueous suspension containing the **TiO₂ (anatase)** support nanoparticles.\n\n    3.  **Deposition/Impregnation:**\n        *   **Slowly inject** the pH-adjusted tetraammineplatinum(II) nitrate solution into the TiO₂ suspension.\n        *   (Implied: Stirring/mixing occurs during injection to ensure uniform contact).\n\n    4.  **Drying:**\n        *   After the injection and mixing is complete, **dry** the resulting solid material. (The specific drying method - e.g., oven drying, rotary evaporation, spray drying - is not specified).\n\n    5.  **Calcination:**\n        *   Place the dried material in a **tube furnace**.\n        *   **Ramp the temperature** from room temperature to the target calcination temperature at a **controlled rate of 10 °C min⁻¹**.\n        *   **Hold** the material at the **final calcination temperature of 450 °C** for **4 hours**.\n        *   Perform calcination under **flowing air** atmosphere.\n\n**Key Synthesis Details & Implications:**\n\n*   **Precursor:** Tetraammineplatinum(II) nitrate is chosen as it decomposes cleanly and the ammine ligands can aid in dispersion.\n*   **pH Control (12.2):** This is critical. The high basic pH likely promotes strong electrostatic interaction or specific adsorption between the cationic [Pt(NH₃)₄]²⁺ complex and the TiO₂ surface (whose point of zero charge is around pH 6-7), facilitating high dispersion and potentially anchoring Pt species to form isolated atoms/clusters during calcination. It also helps prevent premature hydrolysis or precipitation.\n*   **Slow Injection:** Ensures gradual addition of the Pt precursor, minimizing local concentration gradients that could lead to agglomeration.\n*   **Calcination Conditions:**\n    *   **450 °C:** High enough to decompose the platinum ammine complex and any residual nitrates, and to potentially strengthen the Pt-TiO₂ interaction.\n    *   **Flowing Air:** Oxidizes the organic ligands and nitrates, likely resulting in oxidized Pt species (e.g., PtOₓ) initially. *Crucially, this oxidative calcination is often a key step in stabilizing isolated Pt atoms on oxide supports like TiO₂.*\n    *   **Controlled Ramp (10 °C min⁻¹):** Prevents rapid decomposition or sintering that could occur with a faster temperature increase.\n\n**Overall Goal:** The procedure is meticulously designed (pH, slow injection, oxidative calcination) to achieve a highly dispersed Pt catalyst on anatase TiO₂, specifically targeting \"Pt iso\" (isolated atoms or very small clusters), leveraging the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) achievable with TiO₂ under these conditions. The resulting catalyst after calcination likely contains oxidized Pt species (Pt⁺ or Pt²⁺), which would typically be reduced *in situ* prior to catalytic testing to activate the metal sites."

        "input": "What catalysts are synthesized and what are their synthesis procedures?",
        "output": "Based on the provided text, here is a professional summary of the synthesized catalyst and its detailed synthesis procedure:\n\n**Synthesized Catalyst:**  \n**SA-Rh/CN**  \n*   **Full Name:** Single-Atom Rhodium supported on Carbon Nitride.\n*   **Key Feature:** Rhodium (Rh) is atomically dispersed on a defective amorphous carbon nitride (CN) support, derived from ZIF-8.\n*   **Evidence:** PXRD and Raman spectroscopy confirm the carbon nitride support is defective and amorphous. The host-guest strategy using ZIF-8 cages is designed to prevent Rh aggregation and form single atoms (SA).\n\n**Synthesis Procedure (SA-Rh/CN):**\n\nThe synthesis is a two-step process: **(1) Formation of Rh/ZIF-8 Precursor** and **(2) Pyrolysis to SA-Rh/CN**.\n\n**1.  Synthesis of Rh/ZIF-8 Precursor (Host-Guest Complex):**\n    *   **Solution A:** Dissolve 144 mg Rh(acac)₃ (Rhodium(III) acetylacetonate) and 1.19 g Zn(NO₃)₂ (Zinc nitrate) in 15 ml methanol. Stir for 5 minutes.\n    *   **Solution B:** Dissolve 1.31 g 2-Methylimidazole (organic linker) in 30 ml methanol. Stir for 5 minutes.\n    *   **Combination:** Pour both Solution A and Solution B into a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave.\n    *   **Reaction:** Seal the autoclave and heat at 120 °C for 4 hours.\n    *   **Workup:** Cool the autoclave to room temperature. Collect the yellowish solid product by centrifugation.\n    *   **Washing:** Wash the solid thoroughly three times with DMF (Dimethylformamide) and three times with methanol.\n    *   **Product:** Rh/ZIF-8 (Rh(acac)₃ encapsulated within ZIF-8 cages). PXRD confirms homogenous dispersion of Rh(acac)₃ within the intact ZIF-8 framework.\n\n**2.  Synthesis of SA-Rh/CN via Pyrolysis:**\n    *   **Loading:** Place 1 g of the dried Rh/ZIF-8 precursor into a crucible.\n    *   **Furnace Setup:** Place the crucible in a tube-type furnace under a flowing N₂ (Nitrogen) atmosphere.\n    *   **Pyrolysis Program:** Heat the furnace to 900 °C at a controlled heating rate of 5 °C min⁻¹. Hold at 900 °C for a specific duration (2h, 3h, 4h, or 5h) to obtain Rh/CN-Xh. *(Note: To obtain Rh/CN-1100, heat to 1100 °C for 6h at the same ramp rate).*\n    *   **Cooling:** Allow the furnace to cool naturally to room temperature under N₂ flow.\n    *   **Product:** Obtain SA-Rh/CN as a black powder directly usable without further treatment.\n    *   **Characterization:** PXRD and Raman spectra confirm the transformation into defective amorphous carbon nitride (CN) with Rh present as single atoms (SA-Rh).\n\n**Key Synthesis Details & Rationale:**\n\n1.  **Host-Guest Strategy:** ZIF-8 is chosen because the size of the Rh(acac)₃ molecule (9.36 Å) is larger than ZIF-8's small pore windows (3.4 Å) but smaller than its large cavities (11.6 Å). This allows Rh(acac)₃ to enter the cages during synthesis but prevents its escape (\"trapping\"), ensuring atomic dispersion.\n2.  **In Situ Reduction:** During the high-temperature pyrolysis under inert atmosphere (N₂), the ZIF-8 framework carbonizes into nitrogen-doped carbon (CN), and the Rh³⁺ ions in Rh(acac)₃ are simultaneously reduced *in situ* to form Rh⁰ single atoms anchored on the CN support.\n3.  **Morphology Control:** Varying the pyrolysis time (2-5h) or temperature (1100°C) allows tuning the catalyst properties (denoted as Rh/CN-Xh or Rh/CN-1100).\n4.  **Generality:** The identical procedure (steps 1 & 2) using Pd(acac)₂ or Pt(acac)₂ instead of Rh(acac)₃ yields SA-Pd/CN and SA-Pt/CN, respectively.\n5.  **Contrast (Rh/C):** A conventional Rh nanoparticle catalyst on Vulcan carbon (Rh/C) is synthesized separately for comparison via NaBH₄ reduction of RhCl₃·3H₂O in water, followed by deposition onto carbon black.\n\n**In summary:** SA-Rh/CN is synthesized by trapping Rh(acac)₃ within ZIF-8 cages to form Rh/ZIF-8, followed by controlled pyrolysis under N₂ at 900°C (for 2-5h) to simultaneously carbonize the framework and reduce Rh to single atoms dispersed on the resulting defective amorphous carbon nitride support."

This generates free radicals on the protein support.\n    *   **Step 4: Iron Precursor Addition:** 0.1 ml of an aqueous Fe(NO₃)₃·9H₂O EDTA solution (concentration: 108.21 mg ml⁻¹) was added dropwise to the dispersion under magnetic stirring.\n    *   **Step 5: Complexation/Adsorption:** The mixture was stirred magnetically for 12 hours at 25 °C to allow coordination/adsorption of the iron-EDTA complex onto the radical sites of the protein support, forming the single-atom catalysts.\n\n3.  **Synthesis of FeNP@FibBLG (Nanoparticle Catalyst):**\n    *   **Step 1: Start from Fe SA @FibBLG:** The Fe SA @FibBLG dispersion (obtained after Step 5 above) was used as the starting material.\n    *   **Step 2: Iron Reduction:** This dispersion was further irradiated under the same Xenon lamp/UV filter setup (250–380 nm, 27.9 mW cm⁻²) for 18 minutes under anaerobic conditions (maintained to prevent oxidation). This UV photoreduction step converts the single-atom iron species into iron nanoparticles on the fibril support.\n\n4.  **Isolation, Washing, and Storage (Common to all Catalysts):**\n    *   **Collection:** The catalyst particles were collected by centrifugation at 4 °C and 11,100 x g (relative centrifugal force) for 10 minutes.\n    *   **Washing:** The pellet was washed thoroughly with ethanol (10.0 ml per wash, repeated 6 times) to remove unreacted precursors and by-products.\n    *   **Resuspension:** The washed pellet was resuspended in 5.0 ml of deionized water adjusted to pH 2.\n    *   **Drying:** The aqueous suspension was lyophilized (freeze-dried) to obtain the catalyst as a powder.\n    *   **Storage:** The powdered catalysts (Fe SA @FibBLG, Fe SA @BLG, FeNP@FibBLG) were stored at 4 °C.\n\n**Key Distinctions:**\n\n*   **Fe SA @FibBLG vs. Fe SA @BLG:** The synthesis procedure is identical *except* that Fe SA @FibBLG uses **fibrillated BLG powder** as the support, while Fe SA @BLG uses **native (non-fibrillated) BLG powder**.\n*   **FeNP@FibBLG vs. Fe SA @FibBLG:** FeNP@FibBLG is synthesized by taking the freshly made **Fe SA @FibBLG dispersion** and subjecting it to an **additional 18 minutes of UV irradiation** under anaerobic conditions to reduce the iron atoms to nanoparticles.

The amount is carefully chosen to:\n        *   Form soluble cationic cerium complexes: [Ce(OH)₂]⁺ and [Ce(OH)]²⁺.\n        *   Avoid immediate precipitation of Ce(OH)₃ (Ksp = 1.6 × 10⁻²⁰) or later precipitation of Ce(OH)₄ (formed by oxidation of Ce³⁺ to Ce⁴⁺ by dissolved O₂, Ksp = 2 × 10⁻⁴⁸).\n\n4.  **Adsorption (SEA):**\n    *   Continue vigorous stirring for exactly **3 minutes** after ammonia injection.\n    *   **Mechanism:** During this short time, the positively charged cerium complexes ([Ce(OH)₂]⁺ and [Ce(OH)]²⁺) are strongly electrostatically adsorbed (SEA) onto the negatively charged SiO₂ surface (at the achieved pH ~8.7). This adsorption occurs much faster than the oxidation of Ce³⁺ to Ce⁴⁺ and subsequent precipitation of Ce(OH)₄.\n\n5.  **Separation:**\n    *   After 3 minutes of stirring, immediately perform **vacuum filtration** to separate the solid material (SiO₂ with adsorbed cerium complexes) from the liquid.\n    *   *Note:* The final pH of the solution at this point is approximately 8.7.\n\n6.  **Drying:**\n    *   Air-dry the collected solid precipitates overnight at room temperature.\n\n7.  **Grinding:**\n    *   Grind the dried powder to obtain smaller particles.\n\n8.  **Calcination:**\n    *   Transfer the ground powder to a muffle furnace.\n    *   Calcinate the material at either **500 °C or 600 °C** for **12 hours**.\n    *   Use a temperature ramp rate of **5 °C per minute**.\n    *   **Purpose:** This step decomposes the adsorbed cerium complexes/hydroxides and converts them into the final cerium oxide (CeOₓ) \"nanoglue islands\" on the SiO₂ support.\n\n**Scalability:** The procedure is designed to be easily scaled up, routinely producing batches 10 times larger than the described typical procedure.\n\n**Key Scientific Principles Employed:**\n*   **pH Control:** Precise OH⁻ concentration to form soluble cationic Ce³⁺ complexes and avoid hydroxide precipitation.\n*   **Kinetic Advantage (SEA):** Exploiting the faster rate of electrostatic adsorption onto the support compared to the slower rate of Ce³⁺ oxidation to Ce⁴⁺ and subsequent insoluble Ce(OH)₄ formation.\n*   **Strong Electrostatic Adsorption (SEA):** Utilizing the electrostatic attraction between cationic metal complexes and a negatively charged support surface at controlled pH for uniform deposition."

Pt nanoparticles are extremely rare at this loading. A higher loading (1 wt% Pt) was also synthesized for comparison, but this resulted in prevalent Pt nanoparticles due to aggregation.\n\n**Detailed Synthesis Procedure:**\n\n1.  **Support Suspension:** 2 grams of anatase TiO₂ nanoparticles (5 nm particle size, US Research Nanomaterials, stock no. US3838) were suspended in 200 ml of an aqueous solution.\n2.  **pH Control:** The suspension was buffered to **pH 2** using **1 M HCl**.\n3.  **Precursor Addition:** 100 ml of an aqueous solution of Hexachloroplatinic acid (**H₂PtCl₆**) was prepared, also adjusted to **pH 2**. This H₂PtCl₆ solution was **slowly added** into the suspended TiO₂ solution.\n4.  **Ageing:** The mixture was aged for **1 hour** to allow interaction/deposition.\n5.  **Filtration:** The solid material was separated from the liquid phase via **filtration**.\n6.  **Drying (Step 1):** The resulting solid paste was dried in a **vacuum furnace** at **room temperature (RT) overnight**.\n7.  **Drying (Step 2):** The dried material was further dried in an **air oven** at **110 °C overnight**.\n8.  **Calcination:** The dried catalyst precursor was placed in a **quartz tubular reactor**. It was then **calcined at 250 °C** under **flowing air**.\n9.  **Reduction:** Following calcination, the catalyst was **reduced at 250 °C** under a **flowing 10% H₂/He mixture**.\n\n**Key Characterization Findings Validating the Synthesis (0.04 wt% Pt):**\n\n1.  **EXAFS (Fig. 2c, Supp. Fig. 10):**\n    *   A peak at ~1.86 Å confirms Pt-O bonds (Pt anchored to TiO₂ surface).\n    *   **Absence** of peaks characteristic of Pt-Pt bonds (>2.3 Å) confirms the lack of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) or significant clusters.\n    *   Reduction decreases the Pt-O peak intensity, indicating its partial contribution comes from reducible PtOx species.\n2.  **XANES (Supp. Fig. 11; Pt L₃ edge):** An intense white-line peak indicates the highly dispersed Pt is **cationic** (oxidized state).\n3.  **XPS (Supp. Fig. 13):** Supports the cationic state finding, showing Pt remains oxidized even under reduction conditions (1.5 torr H₂, 250 °C).\n4.  **CO-FTIR (Fig. 2d):** Shows two key CO adsorption bands on Pt:\n    *   A distinct peak at **2118 cm⁻¹** is assigned to CO adsorbed on **isolated Ptδ+ atoms**.\n    *   Bands below 2100 cm⁻¹ (e.g., ~2080 cm⁻¹) are assigned to CO on metallic Pt nanoparticles/sites (prevalent at 1 wt% loading). The presence of the 2118 cm⁻¹ peak at 0.04 wt% is direct spectroscopic evidence for Pt single atoms.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe described synthesis procedure successfully produced a **Pt/TiO₂ single-atom catalyst (SAC)** with an ultralow Pt loading of **0.04 wt%**. The critical steps enabling atomic dispersion include the **low precursor concentration**, **controlled acidic pH (pH 2)** during deposition to promote strong metal-support interaction, and **moderate thermal treatments (calcination & reduction at 250 °C)**. Extensive characterization (EXAFS, XANES, XPS, CO-FTIR) unequivocally confirms the Pt is present predominantly as isolated cationic single atoms, dimers, and very small clusters anchored to the TiO₂ surface, with negligible nanoparticle formation. Increasing the Pt loading to 1 wt% leads to Pt nanoparticle formation due to aggregation."

This leads to Ir atoms being incorporated into the SDC lattice upon calcination (ordered solid solution).\n    *   **Reduction:** Treat SDCIr_SG in H₂ at 400°C for 0.5 hours.

Higher ratios (1:2:2) promote atomic homogeneity (SDCIr_SG -> small clusters/SAs), while lower ratios (1:0.1:0.1) lead to inhomogeneity and larger clusters (SDCIr -> larger particles).\n*   **Exsolution:** Reduction (H₂, 400°C, 0.5h) is a crucial step for activating the SDC/Ir catalysts, causing Ir to exsolve from the lattice onto the surface. The *initial distribution* within the lattice dictates the *final Ir configuration* (SAs/NCs vs. particles).\n*   **Method Determines Morphology:** Sol-gel with Ir in precursors + sufficient chelators yields atomically dispersed Ir in the lattice pre-reduction. Impregnation yields Ir nanoparticles on the surface post-calcination."

ZIF-8 precipitates form.\n    *   Collect the ZIF-8 precipitate by centrifugation.\n    *   Wash the precipitate (implied but not explicitly stated - standard practice).\n    *   Dry the washed ZIF-8 powder under vacuum at 80 °C.\n\n2.  **Iridium Deposition & PZS Coating (Forming ZIF-8/Ir@PZS Core-Shell):**\n    *   Disperse 600 mg of the dried ZIF-8 powder in 100 ml methanol.\n    *   Add 7.08 ml of a methanol solution of iridium(IV) chloride (IrCl₄) with a concentration of 1 mg/ml (delivering ~7.08 mg IrCl₄).\n    *   Separately, prepare a solution of 800 mg 4,4′-sulfonyldiphenol (BPS) and 375 mg phosphonitrilic chloride trimer (HCCP, Cl₆N₃P₃) in 250 ml methanol.\n    *   Add the BPS/HCCP methanol solution to the ZIF-8/Ir dispersion.\n    *   Vigorously stir the resulting mixture for 15 minutes.\n    *   Add 3 ml of triethylamine (TEA) to the mixture. (TEA acts as an acid scavenger/catalyst for the polymerization).\n    *   Continue stirring the mixture for 15 hours at room temperature. During this time, the poly(cyclotriphosphazene-co-4,4′-sulfonyldiphenol) (PZS) polymer forms *in situ*, coating the Ir-loaded ZIF-8 particles.\n    *   Collect the resulting ZIF-8/Ir@PZS core-shell composite precipitate by centrifugation.\n    *   Wash the precipitate (implied).\n    *   Dry the washed powder under vacuum at 80 °C.\n\n3.  **Pyrolysis (Forming Ir-SA):**\n    *   Place the dried ZIF-8/Ir@PZS powder in a quartz boat.\n    *   Load the boat into a tube furnace.\n    *   Purge the furnace with flowing argon gas.\n    *   Heat the furnace under continuous argon flow from room temperature to 950 °C at a controlled heating rate of 5 °C per minute.\n    *   Hold the temperature at 950 °C for 3 hours (dwell time).\n    *   Allow the furnace to cool naturally back to room temperature under argon flow.\n    *   Collect the resulting black powder (Ir-SA catalyst).\n    *   **Use:** The Ir-SA catalyst is used without any further treatment or purification.\n\n**Key Synthesis Rationale:**\n\n1.  **ZIF-8:** Serves as a sacrificial template providing a porous structure, zinc (which evaporates during high-T pyrolysis), carbon, and nitrogen.\n2.  **Ir Deposition:** IrCl₄ is adsorbed onto the ZIF-8 surface, providing the iridium source. The high surface area and N-sites help anchor Ir.\n3.  **PZS Coating:** The polymerization of HCCP and BPS forms a cross-linked phosphazene/sulfone polymer shell (PZS) around the ZIF-8/Ir core. This coating:\n    *   Protects the structure during pyrolysis.\n    *   Provides additional carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur for doping the final carbon matrix.\n    *   Helps prevent Ir aggregation during high-temperature treatment.\n4.  **High-T Pyrolysis (950°C under Ar):** This is the critical step:\n    *   Carbonizes the organic components (ZIF-8 ligand and PZS polymer).\n    *   Evaporates zinc (Zn boils at ~907°C).\n    *   Creates a highly porous, nitrogen-doped (and P/S-doped) carbon support.\n    *   Reduces Ir(IV) to metallic Ir(0).\n    *   The combination of the ZIF template, PZS confinement, and high temperature facilitates the formation of *atomically dispersed* Ir sites (Ir-SA) trapped within the N-doped carbon lattice, rather than Ir nanoparticles.\n\nThis synthesis utilizes a templating (ZIF-8), metal deposition, polymer coating (PZS), and controlled pyrolysis strategy to create a single-atom iridium catalyst on a heteroatom-doped carbon support."

Synthesis of Au/CeO₂ Catalyst (6 wt% Au)**\n**Catalyst Composition:** 6 wt% Gold on Cerium Oxide (CeO₂) support.  \n**Method:** Deposition-Precipitation (DP) using pre-synthesized CeO₂ support.  \n**Key Steps:**\n\n1.  **CeO₂ Support Synthesis (Co-precipitation):**\n    *   Dissolve 10 g of ammonium cerium(IV) nitrate ((NH₄)₂Ce(NO₃)₆) in 100 ml deionized water.\n    *   Add 1 g of urea (CO(NH₂)₂).\n    *   Heat the solution to 100°C under vigorous stirring.\n    *   Boil the mixture for 8 hours.\n    *   Wash the resulting precipitate twice with hot deionized water (50–70°C).\n    *   Dry the washed precipitate at 120°C for 12 hours.\n    *   Crush the dried material into a powder.\n    *   Calcinate the powder in air at 400°C for 10 hours. *Result: CeO₂ support powder.*\n\n2.  **Gold Deposition (Incomplete in text):**\n    *   The text cuts off during the DP step for Au addition (\"Next, 1.5 ml\"). Based on standard DP procedures for Au/CeO₂ and the context, this step would involve adding a gold precursor (e.g., HAuCl₄) to a suspension of the CeO₂ support under controlled pH/temperature to deposit Au nanoparticles. The exact details (precursor amount, pH, temperature, time) are missing from the provided excerpt.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Synthesis of Au/α-MoC Catalyst (and other M/α-MoC catalysts)**\n**Catalyst Composition:** Gold (or Pt, Pd, Ir, Rh, Ru) supported on alpha-phase Molybdenum Carbide (α-MoC₁₋ₓ).  \n**General Method:** Temperature-Programmed Carbonization of a Noble Metal/Molybdenum Oxide Precursor.  \n**Key Steps for Au/α-MoC (6 wt% Au):**\n\n1.  **Precursor Formation (Co-evaporation):**\n    *   Prepare an aqueous solution of HAuCl₄ (9.56 g Au L⁻¹). For 6Au/α-MoC, use 6 ml of this solution.\n    *   Add this HAuCl₄ solution dropwise to 20 ml of an aqueous ammonium paramolybdate solution ((NH₄)₆Mo₇O₂₄·4H₂O, 57.35 g L⁻¹) at 80°C under stirring.\n    *   Continue stirring at 80°C until all water is completely evaporated.\n    *   Crush the resulting solid into a powder.\n    *   Dry the powder at 120°C overnight. *Result: Au/MoO₃ precursor powder.*\n\n2.  **MoO₃ Formation (Calcination):**\n    *   Heat the Au/MoO₃ precursor powder in air to 550°C at a heating rate of 10°C min⁻¹.\n    *   Hold at 550°C for 4 hours. *Result: Au/MoO₃ powder.*\n\n3.  **Carburization to α-MoC:**\n    *   Place the Au/MoO₃ powder in a flow of 20% CH₄ / H₂ (100 ml min⁻¹).\n    *   Heat from 25°C to 300°C at 10°C min⁻¹.\n    *   Heat from 300°C to 700°C at **1°C min⁻¹** (very slow ramp critical for phase control).\n    *   Hold at 700°C for 2 hours.\n    *   Cool down to room temperature. *Result: Pyrophoric Au/α-MoC₁₋ₓ catalyst.*\n\n4.  **Passivation:**\n    *   Treat the cooled Au/α-MoC₁₋ₓ with a flow of 2% O₂ / Ar (60 ml min⁻¹) at room temperature for 6 hours. *Result: Stable, passivated Au/α-MoC₁₋ₓ catalyst ready for handling and use.*\n\n**Synthesis of Other Noble Metal Catalysts (Pt, Pd, Ir, Rh, Ru/α-MoC):**\n*   Follow the **exact same procedure** as for Au/α-MoC.\n*   Replace the HAuCl₄ solution with equivalent solutions of:\n    *   H₂PtCl₆ (for Pt/α-MoC)\n    *   PdCl₂ (for Pd/α-MoC)\n    *   IrCl₃ (for Ir/α-MoC)\n    *   RhCl₃ (for Rh/α-MoC)\n    *   RuCl₃ (for Ru/α-MoC)\n*   The resulting catalysts are primarily in the α-MoC₁₋ₓ phase.\n\n---\n\n### **Performance Context (for wM/α-MoC Catalysts)**\n*   These catalysts (wM/α-MoC, M = Au, Pt, Pd, Ir, Rh, Ru; w = wt% metal loading) were screened for the CO-H₂O Assisted Hydrogenation of Ethyne (CO-H₂O-AHE) process.\n*   **Au/α-MoC (specifically 6Au/α-MoC) was identified as the optimum catalyst:**\n    *   Reaction: Feed gas CO/C₂H₂/Ar (6:5:89), 3.2 MPa, 15 ml H₂O.\n    *   Performance at 80°C:\n        *   C₂H₂ Conversion: >99%\n        *   CO Conversion: 82%\n        *   Selectivity: 83% C₂H₄, 11% CH₃CHO, 2% CH₃COOH\n    *   The C₂H₄ yield over 6Au/α-MoC was ~8x higher than over 6Pt/α-MoC or 6Pd/α-MoC, and >26x higher than over 6Ir/α-MoC, 6Rh/α-MoC, or 6Ru/α-MoC.\n\n---\n\n### Key Synthesis Observations\n*   **Au/CeO₂:** Focuses on meticulous CeO₂ support synthesis via urea co-precipitation/calcination. Gold deposition details are incomplete in the provided text.\n*   **Au/α-MoC (and analogues):** Relies on forming a well-mixed noble metal/molybdate precursor via co-evaporation, converting it to the oxide (MoO₃), and then carefully carburizing it under CH₄/H₂ with an extremely slow heating ramp (1°C/min) between 300-700°C to achieve the active α-MoC₁₋ₓ phase. Passivation is essential for safety.\n*   **Phase:** The critical support phase for the high-performance catalyst is α-MoC₁₋ₓ."

This final product is labeled **C(O)** (oxidized carbon black).\n\n    **Stage 2: Metal Deposition (Synthesis of M1/C(O) & Sn1/C)**\n    5.  **Support Dispersion:** 100 mg of the dried C(O) is dispersed in 100 ml of Millipore-filtered water using tip sonication for 1 hour to create a homogeneous dispersion. *(For Sn1/C, unoxidized Vulcan XC-72R is used instead of C(O) in this step).*\n    6.  **Precursor Addition:** 5 ml of a specific metal chloride glycol solution (InCl₂, SnCl₄, or SbCl₃; each solution at 0.5 mg metal per ml) is added **dropwise** to the carbon dispersion under **vigorous stirring**.\n    7.  **Impregnation:** Stirring is continued for 12 hours after precursor addition is complete to allow interaction/adsorption.\n    8.  **Photo-Assisted Deposition/Reduction:**\n        *   The entire mixture is rapidly frozen using liquid nitrogen.\n        *   The frozen mixture is thawed at room temperature while being irradiated with a Xe lamp equipped with a filter (λ > 420 nm). This light assists in reducing the metal ions and anchoring them onto the support.\n    9.  **Workup:**\n        *   The resulting solid is separated by centrifugation.\n        *   It is rinsed (washed) repeatedly with DI water and ethanol.\n    10. **Drying:** The washed solid is dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 hours. This yields the final catalysts: **In1/C(O)**, **Sn1/C(O)**, **Sb1/C(O)**, or the control **Sn1/C**.\n\n**Key Synthesis Features:**\n\n*   **Support Functionalization:** HNO₃ oxidation creates oxygen groups (carboxylic, hydroxyl, carbonyl) on the carbon black surface (`C(O)`), crucial for anchoring metal precursors.\n*   **Metal Loading:** ~1 wt% metal loading is achieved (100 mg support + 5 ml * 0.5 mg/ml metal solution = 2.5 mg metal).\n*   **Deposition Mechanism:** Combines wet impregnation (stirring) with a unique **photo-assisted freezing-thawing method** (Liquid N₂ freeze + Thawing under >420 nm light) likely to promote reduction and nanoparticle formation/stabilization.\n*   **Control:** `Sn1/C` highlights the effect of support oxidation by using pristine carbon black.\n\nThis procedure synthesizes a series of low-loading metal nanoparticle catalysts supported on functionalized carbon black, utilizing a photo-assisted freezing-thawing step for metal deposition."

These are bismuth-decorated platinum nanoparticles supported on carbon, where the (1/x) denotes the Bi:Pt atomic ratio (e.g., 1:1, 1:3, 1:18).\n2.  **Bi(1/3)Pt:** This appears to be a variation or correction specifically for the 1:3 Bi:Pt ratio catalyst, synthesized directly onto carbon support. The naming differs slightly (`Bi(1/3)Pt` vs `Bi(1/3)@Pt`).\n\n**Synthesis Procedures:**\n\n**Method 1: Preparation of Bi(1/x)@Pt (Bi(1/1)@Pt, Bi(1/3)@Pt, Bi(1/18)@Pt)**\n*   **Method:** Chemical Reduction\n*   **Support/Precursor:** Pre-formed Pt/C catalyst (20 wt% Pt, 500 mg).\n*   **Procedure:**\n    1.  **Dispersion/Acidification:** Combine Pt/C (500 mg), deionized water (250 ml), and nitric acid (10 M, 0.15 ml) in a 600 ml beaker.\n    2.  **Initial Stirring:** Vigorously stir the mixture for 12 hours.\n    3.  **Bismuth Addition:** Add Bismuth precursor solution: Bismuth(III) nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO₃)₃·5H₂O) containing the required mass of Bi³⁺ (100 mg for Bi(1/1)@Pt, 33.3 mg for Bi(1/3)@Pt, 8.33 mg for Bi(1/18)@Pt) dissolved in nitric acid (5 M, 50 ml).\n    4.  **Secondary Stirring:** Stir the mixture for an additional 30 minutes.\n    5.  **Neutralization:** Add potassium hydroxide solution (8 M, ~30 ml) to neutralize the acidic mixture.\n    6.  **Reduction:** Slowly add sodium borohydride solution (NaBH₄, 0.05 M, 50 ml) dropwise to uniformly reduce the adsorbed Bi³⁺ species onto the Pt/C surface. *(Text cuts off, but subsequent steps implied)*.\n    7.  **Workup (Implied):** Filter the product, wash thoroughly with deionized water several times, and dry under vacuum at 25 °C.\n\n**Method 2: Preparation of Bi(1/3)Pt**\n*   **Method:** Chemical Reduction\n*   **Support/Precursor:** Carbon support (Vulcan XC-72R, 400 mg) and Platinum precursor (Hexachloroplatinic acid, H₂PtCl₆, equivalent to 100 mg Pt).\n*   **Procedure:**\n    1.  **Dispersion/Acidification:** Combine Carbon (400 mg), H₂PtCl₆ (100 mg Pt equivalent), deionized water (250 ml), and nitric acid (10 M, 0.15 ml) in a 600 ml beaker.\n    2.  **Initial Stirring:** Vigorously stir the mixture for 12 hours. *(This step simultaneously disperses the carbon and adsorbs/prepares the Pt precursor)*.\n    3.  **Bismuth Addition:** Add Bismuth precursor: 33.3 mg of Bi³⁺ (as Bi(NO₃)₃) to the mixture.\n    4.  **Secondary Stirring:** Stir the mixture for an additional 30 minutes.\n    5.  **Neutralization:** Add potassium hydroxide solution (8 M, ~30 ml) to neutralize the acidic mixture.\n    6.  **Reduction:** Slowly add sodium borohydride solution (NaBH₄, 0.05 M, 50 ml) dropwise to uniformly reduce *both* the platinum precursor (forming Pt nanoparticles on carbon) *and* the bismuth species onto the newly formed Pt/C.\n    7.  **Workup:** Filter the product, wash thoroughly with deionized water several times, and dry under vacuum at 25 °C.\n\n**Key Details & Observations:**\n\n1.  **Core Method:** Both syntheses rely on **chemical reduction using NaBH₄**.\n2.  **Support Differences:**\n    *   `Bi(1/x)@Pt`: Uses **pre-formed commercial Pt/C** (20 wt%) as the starting support.\n    *   `Bi(1/3)Pt`: Synthesizes the **Pt/C support *in situ*** from Vulcan XC-72R carbon and H₂PtCl₆.\n3.  **Bismuth Loading:** Controlled precisely by the mass of Bi³⁺ added (100 mg, 33.3 mg, 8.33 mg) to achieve the desired Bi:Pt atomic ratios (1:1, 1:3, 1:18) on the pre-formed Pt/C. For `Bi(1/3)Pt`, 33.3 mg Bi³⁺ is used with 100 mg Pt equivalent.\n4.  **Acid Conditions:** Nitric acid is used in two stages:\n    *   Initial low amount (0.15 ml of 10M) likely for metal precursor dispersion/solubilization and carbon surface functionalization.\n    *   Higher amount (50 ml of 5M) used to dissolve the Bi(NO₃)₃ precursor before addition.\n5.  **Neutralization:** Essential step before reduction. KOH (8M, ~30ml) is added to raise the pH, likely to optimize adsorption of Bi species onto Pt/C and facilitate controlled reduction by NaBH₄.\n6.  **Reduction:** NaBH₄ (0.05M, 50ml) is added **slowly and dropwise** to ensure uniform reduction and deposition of Bi onto the Pt surfaces, minimizing bulk precipitation.\n7.  **Workup:** Standard isolation involves **filtration, thorough water washing** (to remove ions and reaction byproducts), and **low-temperature vacuum drying (25°C)** to preserve the catalyst structure and prevent sintering.\n8.  **Naming:** The text uses both `Bi(1/x)@Pt` and `Bi(1/3)Pt`. The `@` symbol in `Bi(1/x)@Pt` strongly suggests a core(Pt)-shell(Bi) or surface-decorated structure. `Bi(1/3)Pt` lacks the `@`, but the synthesis method and intent are identical to the Bi(1/3)@Pt variant."

This yields a dry powder.\n\n3.  **Grinding:**\n    *   Grind the freeze-dried powder thoroughly in a mortar to ensure uniformity.\n\n4.  **Pyrolysis (Carbonization & Activation):**\n    *   Place the ground powder in a furnace.\n    *   Heat under a continuous argon (Ar) atmosphere to 900 °C.\n    *   Maintain the target temperature (900 °C) for 2 hours.\n    *   Use a controlled heating rate of 5 °C per minute during ramp-up.\n    *   **Purpose:** Carbonize glucose and dicyandiamide to form a nitrogen-doped graphene-like carbon network within the NaCl lattice. Simultaneously, reduce and anchor cobalt atoms within this carbon matrix, forming the SAC structure. The NaCl acts as a template, confining the reaction and leading to the 3D nanosheet morphology.\n\n5.  **Cooling:**\n    *   Allow the furnace to cool down naturally to room temperature under argon. This yields a black powder mixture (Co-SAC nanosheets embedded within NaCl).\n\n6.  **Acid Etching (Template & Impurity Removal):**\n    *   Treat the cooled black powder with 0.5 M Sulfuric Acid (H₂SO₄).\n    *   **Purpose:** Dissolve and remove the NaCl template and any unstable/leachable cobalt species (like nanoparticles or clusters) that are not strongly anchored as single atoms. This isolates the stable Co-SAC material.\n\n7.  **Drying:**\n    *   Wash the acid-etched black powder thoroughly (typically with water until neutral pH).\n    *   Dry the purified catalyst powder at 60 °C.\n    *   The final dried black powder is designated **Co₁CNCl/S**.\n\n**Key Synthesis Rationale:**\n*   **NaCl Template:** Encapsulates precursors during freeze-drying and confines carbon growth during pyrolysis, creating the 3D nanosheet structure. Its removal via acid etching leaves behind the porous carbon network.\n*   **Glucose:** Primary carbon source, forming the graphitic backbone upon pyrolysis.\n*   **Dicyandiamide:** Provides nitrogen for doping the carbon matrix and additional carbon. Nitrogen sites are crucial for anchoring the cobalt single atoms.\n*   **CoSO₄·7H₂O:** Source of cobalt. The high-temperature pyrolysis in an inert atmosphere and subsequent acid leaching favor the formation and isolation of atomically dispersed Co sites coordinated to N in the carbon lattice.\n*   **High-Temperature Pyrolysis (900°C):** Essential for graphitizing the carbon support and forming stable Co-Nₓ sites resistant to acid leaching.\n*   **Acid Etching:** Critical step to remove the template and any non-single-atom cobalt species, confirming the SAC nature.\n\n**Control/Reference Catalysts Mentioned:**\n1.  **Carbon Samples:** Synthesized identically *without* CoSO₄·7H₂O.\n2.  **CN/S:** Synthesized using the same molar amount of Na₂SO₄ *instead of* Co salts. (N-doped carbon with S residue).\n3.  **C/S:** Synthesized *without* Co salts *and without* dicyandiamide, but *with* Na₂SO₄. (S-doped carbon, no N, no Co).\n4.  **Co₁CN & Co₁CN/S:** Synthesized by pyrolyzing Cobalt Phthalocyanine (CoPc) mixed with pre-formed CN or CN/S support (Co ~2 wt%) at 450 °C under Ar for 1 hour.
