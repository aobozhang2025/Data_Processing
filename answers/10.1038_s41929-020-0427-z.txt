question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Catalyst preparation. Commercial γ-alumina (99.97%, Alfa Aesar) was activated by pre-reduction flowing of 10% H 2 :N 2 at 350 ºC for 1 h to create coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ penta sites (rAl 2 O 3 ). The amounts of precious metal and ceria were 1 wt% and 10 wt%, respectively. A Ce(NO 3 ) 3 ·6H 2 O (99.99%, Kanto chemical) with the amount of 38 mg was homogeneously dissolved in 5 ml of deionized water with stirring. The rAl 2 O 3 (133.5 mg) was introduced into the cerium precursor solution, and then the solution was continuously stirred at room temperature for 1 h (CeO 2 –rAl 2 O 3 ). The solution was then heated to the target impregnation temperature (40, 60, 80 or 90 ºC). In the case of the Pt catalysts, 4 mg of H 2 PtCl 6 ·6H 2 O (≤100%, Sigma-Aldrich) was homogeneously dissolved in 5 ml of deionized water, and then the Pt precursor solution was put into the CeO 2 –rAl 2 O 3 solution with stirring. The solution was evaporated completely. The resulting powder was dried overnight at 80 ºC, and the dried powder was calcined in static air at 500 ºC for 5 h. Finally, the calcined powder was reduced in 10% H 2 :N 2 at 500 ºC for 2 h, producing the Pt/CeO 2 –rAl 2 O 3 catalyst. For the Pd or Rh catalysts, H 2 PdCl 4 or H 2 RhCl 5 solution was prepared with a 2:1 molar ratio of HCl to PdCl 2 (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) or RhCl 3 ·xH 2 O (99.98%, Sigma-Aldrich). The other procedures were the same as those for Pt/CeO 2 –rAl 2 O 3 , resulting in Pd/CeO 2 –rAl 2 O 3 or Rh/CeO 2 –rAl 2 O 3 . For the M/CeO 2 –Al 2 O 3 (M/CA) catalysts, ceria and precious metal were sequentially impregnated onto fresh γ-alumina. For the M/rAl 2 O 3 (M/rA) catalysts, precious metal was impregnated onto activated γ-alumina without ceria impregnation. Metal impregnation was performed at 40 ºC for both the M/CA and M/rA catalysts. The other procedures were the same as those for the M/CeO 2 –rAl 2 O 3 catalysts.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalyst and its preparation from a given paragraph. Let me carefully parse this technical text.

The paragraph describes several catalysts: Pt/CeO₂–rAl₂O₃ seems to be the primary one, with variations using Pd or Rh instead of Pt. There are also control catalysts M/CA and M/rA. The synthesis involves multiple precise steps - I should highlight the key procedures without losing critical details.

Hmm, the preparation starts with activating commercial γ-alumina by hydrogen reduction to create special penta-coordinate Al³⁺ sites. That's crucial for the catalyst's properties. Then ceria is deposited first using cerium nitrate solution, followed by precious metal deposition. The temperatures during impregnation (40-90°C) appear to be variable parameters in the study.

For platinum, they use hexachloroplatinic acid, while palladium and rhodium require special precursor solutions with HCl. The post-impregnation steps are consistent: evaporation, drying, calcination at 500°C, and final reduction. The control catalysts skip either ceria deposition or alumina activation.

I notice the user didn't specify which catalyst variant they're most interested in. Since Pt/CeO₂–rAl₂O₃ has the most detailed description, I'll make that the focus while mentioning the others as derivatives. The exact quantities (38mg Ce salt, 133.5mg support) and concentrations (1wt% metal, 10wt% ceria) should be included since they're explicitly stated.

The reduction conditions (10% H₂/N₂ at 350°C and 500°C) seem scientifically important for creating active sites. I should explain why they do this - to generate oxygen vacancies and reduce metal precursors. The calcination step likely forms the metal oxides before final reduction to metallic states.

For clarity, I'll structure the synthesis chronologically: support activation → ceria deposition → metal deposition → drying/calcination/reduction. The alternative catalysts can be covered at the end as comparative materials. The user seems to need this for research purposes, so precision in reporting temperatures, times and precursors is essential.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here's a professional chemist's summary of the catalyst synthesized and the detailed synthesis procedure:

**Catalyst Synthesized:**
The primary catalyst synthesized is **Pt/CeO₂–rAl₂O₃**, where:
*   **rAl₂O₃** = Pre-reduced γ-Al₂O₃ (activated support).
*   **CeO₂** = Cerium oxide (10 wt%).
*   **Pt** = Platinum (1 wt%).

Additionally, analogous catalysts were synthesized:
1.  **Pd/CeO₂–rAl₂O₃** (1 wt% Pd, 10 wt% CeO₂ on rAl₂O₃).
2.  **Rh/CeO₂–rAl₂O₃** (1 wt% Rh, 10 wt% CeO₂ on rAl₂O₃).
3.  **Control Catalysts:**
    *   **M/CeO₂–Al₂O₃ (M/CA):** Precious metal (M = Pt, Pd, Rh, 1 wt%) and CeO₂ (10 wt%) sequentially impregnated onto *fresh* (non-pre-reduced) γ-Al₂O₃. Impregnation temp = 40°C.
    *   **M/rAl₂O₃ (M/rA):** Precious metal (M = Pt, Pd, Rh, 1 wt%) impregnated onto *activated* rAl₂O₃ *without* CeO₂. Impregnation temp = 40°C.

**Detailed Synthesis Procedure for Pt/CeO₂–rAl₂O₃:**

1.  **Support Activation (rAl₂O₃ preparation):**
    *   Take commercial γ-Al₂O₃ (99.97%, Alfa Aesar).
    *   Pre-reduce it under flowing 10% H₂/N₂ gas mixture.
    *   Temperature: 350 °C.
    *   Duration: 1 hour.
    *   Purpose: To create coordinatively unsaturated Al³⁺ penta sites (denoted as rAl₂O₃).

2.  **Ceria Impregnation (CeO₂–rAl₂O₃ preparation):**
    *   Dissolve 38 mg Ce(NO₃)₃·6H₂O (99.99%, Kanto Chemical) homogeneously in 5 ml deionized water with stirring.
    *   Add 133.5 mg of the activated rAl₂O₃ support to the cerium nitrate solution.
    *   Stir the slurry continuously at room temperature for 1 hour.
    *   Heat the slurry to the target impregnation temperature (40, 60, 80, or 90 °C). *[Note: Temperature is a variable in the study]*.
    *   This results in the CeO₂–rAl₂O₃ intermediate support.

3.  **Platinum Impregnation:**
    *   Dissolve 4 mg H₂PtCl₆·6H₂O (≤100%, Sigma-Aldrich) homogeneously in 5 ml deionized water.
    *   Add this Pt precursor solution to the *heated* CeO₂–rAl₂O₃ slurry with stirring.
    *   Continue stirring to ensure contact.

4.  **Drying & Calcination:**
    *   Completely evaporate the solvent (water) from the slurry containing Pt/CeO₂/rAl₂O₃ precursors.
    *   Dry the resulting solid powder overnight at 80 °C.
    *   Calcinate the dried powder in static air.
    *   Calcination Temperature: 500 °C.
    *   Calcination Duration: 5 hours.

5.  **Final Reduction:**
    *   Reduce the calcined powder under flowing 10% H₂/N₂ gas mixture.
    *   Reduction Temperature: 500 °C.
    *   Reduction Duration: 2 hours.
    *   This step produces the final **Pt/CeO₂–rAl₂O₃** catalyst.

**Synthesis Variations for Pd/CeO₂–rAl₂O₃ and Rh/CeO₂–rAl₂O₃:**

*   The procedure is identical to Pt/CeO₂–rAl₂O₃ **except for Step 3 (Metal Precursor Solution):**
    *   **For Pd:** Prepare H₂PdCl₄ solution using PdCl₂ (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) with a 2:1 molar ratio of HCl to PdCl₂.
    *   **For Rh:** Prepare H₂RhCl₅ solution using RhCl₃·xH₂O (99.98%, Sigma-Aldrich) with a 2:1 molar ratio of HCl to RhCl₃.
*   Steps 1 (Support Activation), 2 (Ceria Impregnation), 4 (Drying & Calcination), and 5 (Final Reduction) remain the same.

**Synthesis of Control Catalysts (M/CA & M/rA):**

*   **M/CeO₂–Al₂O₃ (M/CA):**
    *   Use *fresh* γ-Al₂O₃ (not pre-reduced) as the support.
    *   Sequentially impregnate CeO₂ (10 wt%) and then the precious metal (M = Pt, Pd, Rh, 1 wt%) onto the fresh Al₂O₃.
    *   Perform the metal impregnation step at 40 °C.
    *   Drying, Calcination (500°C, 5h, air), and Reduction (500°C, 2h, 10% H₂/N₂) steps are identical to the main Pt/CeO₂–rAl₂O₃ procedure.
*   **M/rAl₂O₃ (M/rA):**
    *   Use *activated* rAl₂O₃ (pre-reduced at 350°C, 1h, 10% H₂/N₂) as the support.
    *   Impregnate *only* the precious metal (M = Pt, Pd, Rh, 1 wt%) directly onto the rAl₂O₃. *Skip the ceria impregnation step entirely.*
    *   Perform the metal impregnation step at 40 °C.
    *   Drying, Calcination (500°C, 5h, air), and Reduction (500°C, 2h, 10% H₂/N₂) steps are identical to the main Pt/CeO₂–rAl₂O₃ procedure.

**Key Features of the Synthesis:**
*   **Sequential Incipient Wetness Impregnation:** Ceria first, then precious metal, onto the activated (rAl₂O₃) or fresh (Al₂O₃) support.
*   **Temperature Control:** Specific temperatures for support activation (350°C), ceria/metal impregnation (variable: 40-90°C for Pt/CeO₂–rAl₂O₃; fixed at 40°C for controls), drying (80°C), calcination (500°C), and final reduction (500°C).
*   **Precursor Specificity:** Different metal precursors required, with Pd and Rh needing specific HCl ratios for solubility/stability.
*   **Post-Treatment:** Standard drying, high-temperature calcination in air, and high-temperature reduction in H₂/N₂ are critical final steps.
