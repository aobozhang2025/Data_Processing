question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Results Synthesis and characterization of catalysts Fe–N–C was synthesized using a simple method. As shown in Fig. 1a, o-phenanthroline and Fe(acac) 3 were ultrasonically mixed and then dried, and the resulting solid was calcined at 700 °C and subsequently washed with 1 M HNO 3 . As shown in Fig. 1b, the calcination-derived Fe–N–C did not possess a distinctive morphology. However, trans- mission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 1c) revealed that the Fe–N–C edges exhibited a thin sheet-like structure. According to spherical-aberration-corrected TEM images, in Fe–N–C, individual iron atoms were present on the carrier surface (Fig. 1d), which was also supported by the X-ray diffraction pattern of the Fe–N–C (supple- mentary Fig. 1), which indicated that the catalyst primarily comprised amorphous carbon and no crystalline substances. This ruled out both iron aggregation and oxides in the catalyst. The elemental maps of the catalyst also revealed that Fe, C, N and O were uniformly distributed in the Fe–N–C (Fig. 1e). The Fe chemical states and local environment were further inves- tigated using the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra. As shown in Fig. 1f, the k 2 -weighted Fourier-transform EXAFS (FT-EXAFS) spectrum showed that in Fe–N–C, Fe was mainly coordinated with N atoms, with a bond length of 1.46 Å, corresponding to the Fe–N bond in iron (II) phthalocyanine (FePc). Meanwhile, no obvious peaks corresponding to the Fe–Fe bond appeared at 2.2 Å, implying the absence of Fe clus- ters and crystalline particles. As shown in Fig. 1g, the Fe K-edge XANES spectrum and valence analysis suggested that in Fe–N–C, the Fe valence state was between +2 and +3. The oxidation states or forms of each ele- ment in Fe–N–C were further characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 1h). In the spectrum of the calcined Fe–N–C, the main Fe peak was near 710 eV, which means that Fe primarily existed in both the +2 and +3 oxidation states. The catalyst contained pyrrolic, pyridinic, graphitic and pyridine oxide N, O predominantly in C–O bonds and sp 2 -hybridized C atoms (supplementary Fig. 2).

Methods Catalyst preparation First, ferric acetylacetonate (Fe(acac) 3 ) and 1,10-ortho-phenanthroline were added to ethanol, and the mixture was stirred well to evenly distribute the components and then ultrasonicated for 30 min. Then, magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH) 2 ) was added to the mixture, which was ultrasonicated for another 30 min and then dried using a rotary evaporator. The obtained solid was dried in an oven at 60 °C and then calcined in nitrogen at 700 °C. The calcined product was washed with 1 M nitric acid, centrifuged and dried to obtain Fe–N–C. Similarly, Co–N–C was synthesized using essentially the same method but with cobalt acetate instead of Fe(acac) 3 . The Mo–Co 3 O 4 and MoS 2 /Fe 2 O 3 samples were prepared using a simple method, as detailed in the Sup- plementary Information.

reasoning: 

Alright, let me approach this query systematically. The user wants a chemist's summary of catalyst synthesis from a technical paragraph. First, I need to identify the core catalyst described - Fe-N-C, with mentions of Co-N-C as a variant. 

Looking at the Methods section, the synthesis has clear steps: starting materials (Fe(acac)₃ and o-phenanthroline), solvent (ethanol), mixing process (stirring + ultrasonication), additive (Mg(OH)₂), drying (rotary evaporator + oven), and thermal treatment (700°C calcination under N₂). Post-treatment involves acid washing with HNO₃. 

The characterization part is rich with details: morphology (amorphous carbon with atomically dispersed Fe), composition (uniform Fe/C/N/O distribution), and oxidation states (Fe²⁺/Fe³⁺ via XPS/XANES). The absence of Fe-Fe bonds in EXAFS confirms atomic dispersion - crucial for catalytic activity. 

I should structure the response in two parts: 
First, the synthesis procedure with exact quantities and conditions. 
Second, characterization highlights proving it's atomically dispersed Fe in N-doped carbon. 
Need to note that Mg(OH)₂ acts as a template but isn't in final catalyst after acid wash. 

The user seems knowledgeable (mentions TEM/XRD/XPS), so I'll maintain technical depth while ensuring clarity. Might emphasize why atomic dispersion matters - prevents aggregation that deactivates catalysts. Also worth noting the comparison to FePc bond length as evidence. 

For Co-N-C variant, I'll mention the cobalt acetate substitution but keep focus on Fe-N-C unless asked. Should clarify that Mo-containing catalysts are described elsewhere. 

Key challenge is condensing extensive characterization into essential proof points without losing critical details like Fe-N coordination distance or absence of 2.2Å peak. The oxidation state ambiguity (+2/+3) should be presented as-is since both XANES and XPS agree. 

Finally, I'll highlight the practical significance: acid-wash removes inactive species, leaving active Fe-Nₓ sites. This addresses why the synthesis method produces effective catalysts.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here is a professional chemist's summary of the synthesized catalyst and its detailed synthesis procedure:

**Synthesized Catalyst:**
*   **Primary Catalyst:** Fe–N–C (Iron coordinated with Nitrogen on a Carbon support).
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   **Structure:** Amorphous carbon matrix with atomically dispersed Fe atoms coordinated to N atoms (Fe-Nₓ sites).
    *   **Morphology:** Thin sheet-like structure observed at edges; no distinctive overall morphology after calcination.
    *   **Composition:** Uniform distribution of Fe, C, N, and O.
    *   **Iron State:** Fe atoms primarily in +2 and +3 oxidation states, coordinated with N (Fe-N bond length ~1.46 Å). **Crucially, no Fe clusters, nanoparticles, crystalline oxides (Fe₂O₃), or Fe-Fe bonds are present.**
    *   **Nitrogen States:** Contains pyrrolic, pyridinic, graphitic, and pyridine oxide N.
    *   **Carbon/Oxygen:** Oxygen predominantly in C–O bonds; carbon primarily sp²-hybridized.

**Detailed Synthesis Procedure for Fe–N–C:**

1.  **Precursor Solution Preparation:**
    *   Dissolve **Ferric acetylacetonate (Fe(acac)₃)** and **1,10-ortho-phenanthroline (o-phenanthroline)** in **ethanol**.
    *   **Stir** the mixture thoroughly to ensure even distribution.
    *   **Ultrasonicate** the mixture for **30 minutes**.

2.  **Template Addition:**
    *   Add **Magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)₂)** to the mixture.
    *   **Ultrasonicate** the new mixture for another **30 minutes**.

3.  **Drying:**
    *   Remove the solvent using a **rotary evaporator**.
    *   Further dry the resulting solid in an **oven at 60 °C**.

4.  **Calcination (Pyrolysis):**
    *   Place the dried solid in a furnace.
    *   **Calcinate** under an inert **nitrogen (N₂) atmosphere**.
    *   **Temperature:** 700 °C.
    *   **Holding Time:** Not explicitly stated (typically 1-2 hours is common, but the text doesn't specify).

5.  **Post-Treatment (Acid Washing):**
    *   Wash the **calcined product** with **1 M Nitric Acid (HNO₃)**.
    *   **Centrifuge** the mixture to separate the solid catalyst from the acid wash.
    *   **Dry** the solid to obtain the final **Fe–N–C catalyst**.

**Key Confirmation from Characterization:**
*   The acid wash removes soluble species (likely Mg-based compounds from the Mg(OH)₂ template).
*   XRD confirms amorphous carbon and **no crystalline phases** (ruling out Fe/Fe-oxide particles).
*   TEM (especially spherical-aberration-corrected) and EXAFS (absence of Fe-Fe peak at ~2.2 Å) **conclusively prove atomic dispersion of Fe** coordinated to N.
*   XPS and XANES confirm Fe is in mixed +2/+3 oxidation states.
*   Elemental mapping shows homogeneous distribution of Fe, C, N, O.

**Additional Notes:**
*   **Co–N–C:** Synthesized identically to Fe–N–C, but using **Cobalt acetate (Co(CH₃COO)₂)** instead of Fe(acac)₃.
*   **Other Catalysts (Mo–Co₃O₄, MoS₂/Fe₂O₃):** Prepared using different methods detailed in the Supplementary Information, not described in the provided text.
*   **Role of Mg(OH)₂:** Acts as a sacrificial template during pyrolysis, helping to create porosity and structure in the carbon matrix, which is subsequently removed during the acid wash.

In summary, the synthesis produces an **atomically dispersed Fe–N–C catalyst** characterized by Fe atoms solely coordinated to nitrogen atoms within an amorphous, N-doped carbon matrix with a sheet-like morphology, achieved through a straightforward procedure involving precursor mixing, templating, high-temperature pyrolysis, and critical acid leaching.
