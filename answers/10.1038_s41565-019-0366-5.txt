question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Preparation of catalysts. For 0.25% Pt/α-MoC, samples with 0.25 wt% Pt loading were prepared using the wetness impregnation method with passivated α-MoC as support21. The slurry was stirred for 2 h under Ar protection. The liquid was removed using a rotary evaporator under vacuum at 35 °C. Finally, the powder was put in a frozen dryer overnight to remove the residual moisture. Ru/Al 2 O 3 and 0.5% Pt/TiO 2 were prepared using a similar method. For 0.5% Pt/C (reference catalyst), the 5% Pt/C commercial catalyst (Alfa-Aesar) was diluted using Vulcan XC-72. For 0.08% Pt 1 /FeO x , an aqueous solution of chloroplatinic acid and ferric nitrate (Fe(NO 3 ) 3 ·9H 2 O, 1 mol l−1) was co-precipitated, with the pH value of the resulting solution controlled at about 8 by sodium carbonate at 50 °C. The recovered solid was dried at 60 °C overnight and calcined at 400 °C for 5 h. Before characterization and reactivity testing, the samples were reduced in 10% H 2 /He at 250 °C for 0.5 h18,27. This catalyst was provided by B. Qiao as used in a previous study18.

reasoning: 

Alright, let me approach this systematically. The user wants a chemist's perspective on synthesizing catalysts from this technical paragraph, so I need to extract every detail with precision. 

First, I'll identify each catalyst mentioned: 0.25% Pt/α-MoC, Ru/Al₂O₃, 0.5% Pt/TiO₂, 0.5% Pt/C, and 0.08% Pt₁/FeOₓ. The synthesis methods vary, so I must separate them clearly.

For the wetness impregnation group (Pt/α-MoC, Ru/Al₂O₃, Pt/TiO₂), the key steps are: using passivated support, argon-protected stirring, rotary evaporation at 35°C, and freeze-drying. The Pt/C reference is simpler - just diluting a commercial catalyst. 

The Pt₁/FeOₓ is more complex: co-precipitation at pH 8 with sodium carbonate at 50°C, followed by drying and calcination. The pre-reduction step in H₂/He is critical for activation and applies to all catalysts. 

I notice the user emphasizes "all details," so I'll include exact parameters like temperatures, durations, and concentrations. The mention of specific references (18,21,27) suggests academic context, so I'll preserve those citations. 

The challenge is presenting this densely technical information clearly while maintaining accuracy. I'll structure it catalyst-by-catalyst with subheadings, and highlight the universal reduction step separately since it's a common final activation. 

Hmm, should I explain why certain steps matter? Like freeze-drying preserves structure or calcination decomposes precursors? Probably not - the user asked strictly for synthesis procedures, not mechanisms. Stay focused on the "how."
