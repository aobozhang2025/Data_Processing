question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Preparation of the Ru–zeolite catalysts Prior to ruthenium loading, the zeolite powder was exchanged with NH 4 + , Na + and Cs + . The NH 4 + exchange was performed in an aque- ous solution of ammonia (0.015 M) at room temperature for 16 h (200 ml solution g zeolite −1 ). The Na + form was obtained from the NH 4 + zeolite via two successive ion-exchange steps at room temperature lasting 16 h each, using 100 ml of 1.0 M aqueous solution of NaCl per 1 g of dry zeolite. Furthermore, the Cs + form was obtained after two successive room temperature ion-exchange steps (48 h and 72 h) with a 0.1 M aqueous solution of caesium acetate (25 ml g −1 ). For each exchange step, the zeolite powder was recuperated via centrifugation, washed with water and air dried at 80 °C (ref. 45). Finally, the zeolites were loaded with 0.2 wt% Ru by ion exchange after adding 1 g of the Cs–zeolite to 100 ml aqueous solution contain- ing the required amount of ruthenium precursor, Ru(NH 3 ) 6 Cl 3 . After 24 h, the zeolite powder was filtered, washed once with distilled water and dried at 50 °C.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalyst preparation details from the given paragraph. Let me analyze this carefully.

The paragraph describes synthesizing Ru-zeolite catalysts through ion exchange. First, they prepare different zeolite forms: NH₄⁺, Na⁺, and Cs⁺. The NH₄⁺ exchange uses 0.015M ammonia solution at room temperature for 16 hours with 200ml/g zeolite. Then Na⁺ form comes from two exchanges (16h each) with 1M NaCl at 100ml/g. Cs⁺ form requires two exchanges (48h + 72h) with 0.1M CsOAc at 25ml/g. After each step, they centrifuge, wash with water, and dry at 80°C.

The actual catalyst synthesis involves loading 0.2wt% Ru onto Cs-zeolite. They use Ru(NH₃)₆Cl₃ precursor in aqueous solution (1g zeolite per 100ml solution), exchange for 24 hours, then filter, wash once with distilled water, and dry at 50°C. 

I notice the user specifically asked for "all details" - so I'll include concentrations, durations, temperatures, volumes, and precursor names. The reference to "ref. 45" suggests this might be for academic work, so precision is crucial. 

Hmm, interesting they used Cs⁺-zeolite specifically for Ru loading - probably due to cation size compatibility. The drying temperatures differ between support prep (80°C) and final catalyst (50°C), likely to preserve Ru complexes. 

I'll structure the summary clearly: first zeolite modifications, then Ru loading. Should highlight that this is an ion-exchange catalyst where Ru replaces Cs⁺ ions. Might add a professional note about why Cs⁺ was chosen if the user seems technically inclined.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here's a professional summary of the synthesized catalyst and its detailed synthesis procedure:

1.  **Catalyst Synthesized:**
    *   **Ru-Cs-Zeolite Catalyst**
    *   **Composition:** 0.2 wt% Ruthenium (Ru) supported on a Cesium (Cs⁺) ion-exchanged Zeolite.
    *   **Key Feature:** Ruthenium is loaded onto a zeolite support specifically pre-exchanged to the cesium (Cs⁺) form via ion exchange using Ru(NH₃)₆Cl₃.

2.  **Detailed Synthesis Procedure:**

    **Step 1: Zeolite Support Pre-Treatment (Ion Exchange Series)**
    *   **NH₄⁺ Exchange:**
        *   **Solution:** 0.015 M aqueous ammonia (NH₄OH).
        *   **Conditions:** Room Temperature (RT), 16 hours.
        *   **Ratio:** 200 ml solution per gram of zeolite.
        *   **Workup:** Centrifuge to recuperate zeolite powder, wash with water, air-dry at 80 °C.
    *   **Na⁺ Exchange (from NH₄⁺-Zeolite):**
        *   **Solution:** 1.0 M aqueous Sodium Chloride (NaCl).
        *   **Conditions:** Room Temperature (RT), two successive exchanges, each lasting 16 hours.
        *   **Ratio:** 100 ml solution per gram of *dry* zeolite per exchange.
        *   **Workup:** After each exchange: Centrifuge, wash with water, air-dry at 80 °C.
    *   **Cs⁺ Exchange (from Na⁺-Zeolite):**
        *   **Solution:** 0.1 M aqueous Caesium Acetate (CsOAc).
        *   **Conditions:** Room Temperature (RT), two successive exchanges (first: 48 hours, second: 72 hours).
        *   **Ratio:** 25 ml solution per gram of zeolite per exchange.
        *   **Workup:** After each exchange: Centrifuge, wash with water, air-dry at 80 °C. *Result: Cs-Zeolite support.*

    **Step 2: Ruthenium Loading onto Cs-Zeolite**
    *   **Precursor:** Ruthenium(III) hexamine chloride (Ru(NH₃)₆Cl₃).
    *   **Solution:** Aqueous solution containing the precise amount of Ru(NH₃)₆Cl₃ required to achieve **0.2 wt% Ru** on the final catalyst.
    *   **Loading Method:** Ion Exchange.
    *   **Conditions:**
        *   **Ratio:** 1 gram of dry Cs-Zeolite added to 100 ml of the Ru precursor solution.
        *   **Duration:** 24 hours (exchange time).
        *   **Temperature:** Room Temperature (RT).
    *   **Workup:**
        1.  Filter the zeolite powder from the solution.
        2.  Wash the recovered zeolite powder **once** with distilled water.
        3.  Dry the washed powder at **50 °C**.

**Key Synthesis Insights:**
*   The core synthesis strategy is **sequential ion exchange** to modify the zeolite support cation (NH₄⁺ → Na⁺ → Cs⁺) before finally loading the active Ru metal, also via ion exchange.
*   The Cs⁺ form of the zeolite is deliberately chosen as the support for the final Ru loading step.
*   Ru is loaded as the cationic hexamine complex [Ru(NH₃)₆]³⁺, displacing Cs⁺ ions.
*   Workup (centrifugation/filtration, washing, drying) is meticulously performed after *every* ion exchange step.
*   Drying temperatures differ: 80°C for the support modifications, and a lower 50°C for the final Ru-loaded catalyst (likely to preserve the Ru complex or prevent sintering).
*   The Ru loading is precisely controlled (0.2 wt%) by calculating the required amount of Ru precursor.
