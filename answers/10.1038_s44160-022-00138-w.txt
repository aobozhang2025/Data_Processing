question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Chemicals and materials. Nickel(II) acetate tetrahydrate (Aladdin, N112914, NiC4H6O4·4H2O, 99%), manganese acetate (Aladdin, M110793, MnC4H6O4·4H2O, AR), zinc acetate dihydrate (Aladdin, Z110777, C4H6O4Zn·2H2O, AR), palladium chloride (Aladdin, P196359, PdCl2, 99.999 %, metal basis), ammonia solution (Aladdin, A112077, NH3·H2O, 25–28%, AR), citric acid monohydrate (Aladdin, C112632, C6H8O7·H2O, AR), dicyandiamide (Aladdin, D100429, C2H4N4, 98%), potassium bicarbonate (Aladdin, P110485, KHCO3, 99.5%), hydrochloric acid solution (Beijing Chemical Works, A0300003, HCl, 35–38 %), sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate (S116311, C6H5Na3O7·2H2O, 99%), ethanol (Beijing Chemical Works, C2H5OH, B0301002, ≥99.8%), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, Aldrich, 98%), 5% Nafion solution (Dupont), 212 Nafion membrane (Alfa Aesar), anion-exchange membrane (Fumasep, FAA-PK-130), ultrapure water (Millipore, 18.2 MΩ cm) used for all processes, Ar and CO2 (Changchun Juyang Gas Ltd, ≥99.999 %), carbon paper (CeTech, N1S1007), gas diffusion electrode (Sigracet, 39BB). These chemicals were used without further purification.  Preparation of carbon substrate. Sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate (10 g) was dried in an oven at a temperature of 150 °C for 48 h. Then, the reaction temperature was decreased to room temperature, and a white powder was obtained and transferred into a porcelain boat and heated for 1 hour at a fixed temperature (800 °C) and a temperature ramp rate of 5 °C min−1 using Ar flow. The harvested black powder was treated with 5 M H2SO4 solution for 12 h at 80 °C, and several washing processes with ultrapure water and ethanol, as well as 6 h drying at 75 °C.  Preparation of NC. As-synthesized carbon substrate (100 mg) and dicyandiamide (1 g) were well mixed by grinding together and heated for 2 hours at 800 °C (temperature rate of 5 °C min−1) using gas flow of Ar. Then, NC was collected through a washing process using ultrapure water and ethanol and a 6 h drying process at a fixed temperature of 75 °C.  Preparation of Ni2NC and Ni1NC. First, nickel(II) acetate tetrahydrate (12.8 mg) and citric acid monohydrate (32.2 mg) were dissolved in 2 ml of ethanol and the solution kept at room temperature with stirring for 1 h. Subsequently, on adding the carbon substrate (100 mg) into the solution, the mixture was stirred continuously under ambient conditions for 6 h, and the resulting dispersion  changed to a black solid after 12 h drying at 75 °C. After grinding with dicyandiamide (1 g) in a mortar, the black solid was transferred into a porcelain boat. The black solid was heated for 2 h at 800 °C with a temperature rate of 5 °C min−1 with an Ar stream. Ni2NC was obtained after washing several times with 3 M HCl solution and ultrapure water, and then drying for 12 h at 80 °C. Ni1NC was obtained using a similar procedure, except that ammonia solution (50 μl) was added in the first step. To study the influence of pyrolysis temperature, the molar ratio of metal precursors and chelating agent (citric acid) and the amount of nitrogen source (dicyandiamide) on the morphology and the dispersion of dual metal atom on NC, more contrast samples were synthesized as follows: (1) the pyrolysis temperature was varied from 800 °C to 700 °C and 900 °C; (2) the ratio of metal precursors and chelating agents was changed from 1:3 to 1:2 and 1:4; and (3) the amount of dicyandiamide was changed from 1 g to 0.5 g and 1.5 g. Additionally, large-scale synthesis of Ni2NC was carried out with 20-fold higher amounts of precursors compared to the above synthesis procedure for Ni2NC.  Preparation of Mn2NC, Zn2NC and Pd2NC. Mn2NC, Zn2NC and Pd2NC were synthesized using a similar procedure to that used for fabricating Ni2NC. The amounts of the metal salt and citric acid monohydrate used in each synthesis were: manganese acetate (4.5 mg) and citric acid monohydrate (11.48 mg); zinc acetate dihydrate (3.4 mg) and citric acid monohydrate (9.64 mg); palladium chloride (1.67 mg) and citric acid monohydrate (5.92 mg).

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalysts and procedures from this technical paragraph. 

First, I need to identify all the catalysts mentioned. Scanning through, I see NC (nitrogen-doped carbon), then Ni2NC and Ni1NC (nickel-based catalysts), followed by Mn2NC, Zn2NC and Pd2NC using other metals. The naming convention seems to indicate metal type and possibly coordination (e.g., Ni2 might refer to dimeric nickel sites).

The synthesis procedures have three main parts: carbon substrate preparation, NC synthesis, and metal-loaded catalysts. For the carbon substrate, they start with sodium citrate pyrolysis at 800°C under argon, then acid wash with sulfuric acid. Interesting - the citrate acts as carbon precursor here. 

Then for NC, they mix this carbon with dicyandiamide (nitrogen source) and pyrolyze again at 800°C. The metal-loaded versions involve dissolving metal acetates with citric acid (chelating agent) in ethanol, impregnating the carbon substrate, drying, then mixing with dicyandiamide for pyrolysis. Post-synthesis acid washing is crucial to remove unstable species - noted they use HCl for nickel catalysts.

The ammonia addition in Ni1NC synthesis is particularly intriguing. That small modification likely creates different metal coordination environments. The parametric studies (temperature, ratios, nitrogen source amount) show they're optimizing metal dispersion - important for catalytic activity.

For Pd/Mn/Zn versions, they simply scale the metal salts while keeping the same procedure. The exact metal:citric acid ratios differ per metal - probably calculated based on coordination chemistry. 

Hmm, the user seems to be a researcher needing clear synthesis replication details. I should emphasize: 1) all precursor amounts, 2) exact pyrolysis conditions (ramp rates, durations), 3) critical washing steps, and 4) the ammonia modification for Ni1NC. The parametric variations are also worth mentioning as they affect catalyst morphology.

The large-scale synthesis note suggests practical application potential. I'll structure the summary by catalyst type while cross-referencing shared procedures to avoid repetition. Must include all quantitative details - that 20-fold scale-up factor is easily missed but important.

**Key Catalyst Features:** The procedures aim to create catalysts where transition metal atoms (Ni, Mn, Zn, Pd) are atomically dispersed and coordinated within a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix, likely forming M-Nₓ active sites. The ammonia addition in Ni1NC modifies the nickel coordination environment compared to Ni2NC. The acid washing steps are critical for removing unstable species and exposing the active metal sites.
