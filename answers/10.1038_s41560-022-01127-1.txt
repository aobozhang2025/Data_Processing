question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Preparation of Pt@BT-O, Pt@BT and Pt@TiO 2 . Pt was introduced via a wet impregnation of substrates (50 mg) with a certain concentration of H 2 PtCl 6 aqueous solution (0.1 ml), followed by the calcination at 513 K for 2 h in vacuum (< 0.1 Pa). The prepared catalyst was stored in vacuum.

Catalyst preparation Preparation of BT. The BT was produced via a facile solid-state treat- ment of Degussa P25 TiO 2 with NaBH 4 (ref. 34 ). In detail, a mixture of 1.0 g of Degussa P25 TiO 2 and 2.0 g of NaBH 4 was ground thoroughly for 0.5 h. The mixture was then heated in a tube furnace at 623 K for 1 h in a vacuum (< 2.0 Pa), followed by natural cooling to room temperature. The black powders obtained after the treatment were washed 6–8 times with deionized water and then dried in a vacuum oven. The BET surface area of the as-synthesized BT was measured to be 84.4 m 2 g −1 .

Preparation of Pt2+@BT-O. Pt was introduced via a conventional wet impregnation of substrates (50 mg) with a certain concentration of (Pt(NH 3 ) 4 )(NO 3 ) 2 aqueous solution (0.1 ml), followed by the calcina- tion at 513 K for 2 h in a vacuum (<0.1 Pa). The prepared catalyst was stored in vacuum.

Preparation of BT-O. The as-synthesized BT (50 mg) was dispersed in the aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide (5 M, 10 ml) and stirred for 1 h at 298 K. The suspension was filtered to obtain a precipitate, which was washed with deionized water and then dried in a vacuum oven at 353 K. The BET surface area of the as-synthesized BT-O was measured to be 98.3 m 2 g −1 .

Preparation of Pt0 NPS @BT-O. The metallic Pt 0 -modified BT-O catalyst was obtained through the chemical-reducing H 2 PtCl 6 in a NaBH4 aque- ous solution. Specifically, 0.2 g of BT-O powders was added into 50 ml of aqueous solution of H 2 PtCl 6 , followed by stirring under darkness overnight. Then, 5 ml of NaBH 4 (0.2 M) and NaOH (0.05 M) solution was added dropwise with vigorous stirring at room temperature. After 1 h reduction, the material was washed with water and then dried in a vac- uum oven at 383 K for 5 h. The prepared catalyst was stored in vacuum. The synthetic conditions of all catalysts were summarized in Sup- plementary Table 8.

reasoning: 

Alright, the user wants me to summarize the catalysts synthesized and their detailed procedures from a chemistry paper. Let me start by breaking down each section. 

First, I notice there are multiple catalysts: Pt@BT-O, Pt@BT, Pt@TiO2, BT, Pt2+@BT-O, BT-O, and Pt0 NPs@BT-O. Each has a specific prep method. The user is likely a chemist or researcher needing precise synthesis details for replication or study. 

Looking at the procedures, wet impregnation is common for Pt-based catalysts, but the precursors and substrates vary. For example, Pt@BT-O and Pt@BT use H₂PtCl₆, while Pt2+@BT-O uses (Pt(NH₃)₄)(NO₃)₂. The calcination steps are similar, but substrates differ. 

The BT synthesis involves solid-state reaction with NaBH₄. Important details here: grinding time, temperature, vacuum pressure, washing steps. BET surface area is provided, which might be crucial for the user's application. 

BT-O preparation uses H₂O₂ oxidation of BT. The concentration, volume, and drying conditions are specific. BET increased from BT, indicating structural changes. 

Pt0 NPs@BT-O uses a reduction method with NaBH₄. The darkness during stirring suggests light sensitivity. NaBH₄/NaOH solution addition is dropwise, which is critical for nanoparticle formation. Drying at 383K is higher than others. 

The user might need these details for catalyst performance comparison. They might be interested in how Pt oxidation states (0 vs 2+) affect catalysis. Storage in vacuum is consistently mentioned, implying air sensitivity. 

I should ensure all parameters are included: masses, volumes, concentrations, temps, times, pressures. Also, highlight differences in Pt precursors and reduction methods. Mentioning BET values could be important for surface area-dependent applications. 

Need to check if all catalysts are covered. Supplementary Table 8 is referenced, but since it's not provided, focus on the text. Make sure terms like "BT" (likely black titanium oxide) are clarified. Avoid markdown but keep structure clear. 

Finally, summarize concisely but thoroughly, as the user probably needs this for lab work or a report. Emphasize key variations in procedures that might influence catalyst properties.
