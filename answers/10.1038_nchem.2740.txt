question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Preparation of Co –S MoS 2 catalyst. The isolated Co atom promoted S MoS 2 (Co –S MoS 2 ) catalyst was prepared using a hydrothermal method. 50.6 mg of cobalt acetate tetrahydrate and 36 mg of thiourea were added to 1 ml of water and left overnight to form the complex Co ion Co(thiourea) 4 2+ (ref. 28). Subsequently this Co thiourea complex solution was then added into 50 ml of 1 mg ml − 1 stabilized S MoS 2 colloid (30 v/v% isopropanol/water with 50 mg of polyvinylpyrrolidone). A mixed homogeneous solution was then transferred to an autoclave, followed by hydrothermal treatment at 160 °C for 24 h. In order to anchor Co atoms onto the defects of S MoS 2 rather than inducing a fast self-nucleation, we used a very low concentration of the Co complex. During the hydrothermal process, the thiourea – Co complex re fi lled some of the surface sulfur vacancy sites of S MoS 2 . Previous studies con fi rm that defective vacancy sites possess high molecular af fi nity, especially for thiol-based molecules17 – 19. After the reaction, the precipitate was washed three times using deionized water and then dried under vacuum for 12 h and fi nally treated with H 2 at 300 °C for 1 h prior to storage.

Methods Preparation of single-layered MoS 2 ( S MoS 2 ). In a typical experiment, 0.5 g of bulk MoS 2 crystalline powder was soaked in 4 ml of 1.6 M n-butyllithium/hexane for 48 h under nitrogen atmosphere. After the intercalation of MoS 2 by lithium, the produced Li x MoS 2 was washed using vacuum fi ltration with 50 ml of hexane to remove excess butyllithium and organics and then dried under N 2 . Then the powder was immersed in 250 ml of water and the resulting suspension was sonicated to assist the completion of the exfoliation process, as any intercalated lithium would react with water to form H 2 gas between the layers. The evolution of H 2 tended to assist the separation of MoS 2 layers. The dispersion was centrifuged at 5,000 r.p.m. for 15 min to remove unexfoliated precursor and only the supernatant was collected by pipette. Eventually, the exfoliated MoS 2 layers remained totally suspended in aqueous solution. The pH value of the dispersion became alkaline due to the presence of trace lithium hydroxide. To collect the S MoS 2 powder HCl solution was added dropwise into the above colloid until the pH value reached around 7. The precipitate was then washed and collected by centrifugation several times and the fi nal product was dried under vacuum for 12 h.

Preparation of F MoS 2 . 6 g of bulk MoS 2 powder was dispersed in 400 ml of isopropanol/water at 30% v/v, and 4 ml of hydrazine monohydrate26. The system was sonicated for 12 h, and then centrifuged at 2,000 r.p.m. for 60 min to remove non-exfoliated sediments. In order to collect the exfoliated F MoS 2 powder from suspension, we changed the pH to around 7 by adding HCl solution. The charge balance in the dispersion would be disrupted, which would cause a fast fl occulation. The fi nal products were centrifuged, washed with deionized water three times and dried in the vacuum container for 12 h.

reasoning: 

Hmm, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalyst preparation procedures from a detailed paragraph. They've provided quite technical text about synthesizing cobalt-promoted molybdenum disulfide catalysts.

Looking at this material, I see three distinct synthesis procedures here: 1) Preparation of single-layered MoS₂ (called S MoS₂), 2) Preparation of another form called F MoS₂, and 3) The actual cobalt-promoted catalyst (Co-S MoS₂). The user specifically asked about the catalyst synthesis, so I should focus primarily on the Co-S MoS₂ part, but I notice the S MoS₂ preparation is actually a prerequisite for making the catalyst.

The synthesis method for Co-S MoS₂ uses hydrothermal treatment. Interesting approach - they're using a cobalt-thiourea complex at very low concentration to specifically anchor cobalt atoms onto sulfur vacancy sites rather than allowing cobalt to form separate nanoparticles. This targeted defect engineering is quite sophisticated. The thiourea ligands seem crucial for directing the cobalt to the vacancies.

For completeness, I should also summarize the preparation of the S MoS₂ support material since it's fundamental to the catalyst synthesis. The lithium intercalation exfoliation method they describe is a standard approach for producing single-layer MoS₂, but they've included all the specific details about washing, sonication, pH adjustment etc.

The F MoS₂ preparation appears to be an alternative method using hydrazine instead of lithium, but since the catalyst specifically uses S MoS₂ as support, I can mention this more briefly as supplementary information.

I'll organize this systematically: first explain what Co-S MoS₂ is, then detail its synthesis procedure step-by-step, followed by the preparation methods for the support materials. I should maintain precise terminology (like "sulfur vacancies" instead of just "defects") and include all critical parameters (temperatures, concentrations, time periods) since the user emphasized "all the details."

The user seems knowledgeable about chemistry given how they framed the question, so I'll keep the explanation technical but clear. They're probably either a researcher or student needing this for practical work or literature review, so accuracy is paramount. I'll highlight the scientific rationale behind key steps too, like why they used low cobalt concentration - that's important for understanding the catalyst design.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here's a professional chemist's summary of the synthesized catalyst and its detailed synthesis procedures:

**Synthesized Catalyst:**
*   **Name:** Isolated Cobalt Atom-Promoted Sulfur-Deficient Single-Layer Molybdenum Disulfide
*   **Notation:** Co–S MoS₂
*   **Key Feature:** Single cobalt (Co) atoms anchored onto sulfur vacancy sites within a single-layer MoS₂ support that is inherently sulfur-deficient (denoted S MoS₂).
*   **Purpose:** The sulfur vacancies in S MoS₂ act as high-affinity anchoring sites for the Co atoms, facilitated by a thiourea complex, preventing Co nanoparticle formation and creating atomically dispersed Co catalysts.

**Detailed Synthesis Procedures:**

1.  **Preparation of Single-Layer Sulfur-Deficient MoS₂ Support (S MoS₂):** *(Prerequisite for Catalyst)*
    *   **Lithium Intercalation:** 0.5 g bulk crystalline MoS₂ powder is soaked in 4 ml of 1.6 M n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) in hexane under N₂ atmosphere for 48 hours. This forms lithium-intercalated MoS₂ (LiₓMoS₂).
    *   **Washing:** LiₓMoS₂ is washed via vacuum filtration using 50 ml hexane to remove excess n-BuLi and organics. It is then dried under N₂.
    *   **Exfoliation:** The dried LiₓMoS₂ powder is immersed in 250 ml water. The suspension is sonicated to complete exfoliation. Intercalated lithium reacts with water, generating H₂ gas between layers, forcing them apart.
    *   **Centrifugation:** The dispersion is centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 15 minutes. Un-exfoliated material forms a pellet.
    *   **Collection of Supernatant:** The supernatant (containing exfoliated single-layer S MoS₂) is collected by pipette. The dispersion is alkaline (pH >7) due to trace LiOH.
    *   **Neutralization & Collection:** HCl solution is added dropwise to the colloid until pH ≈ 7. This causes the S MoS₂ to precipitate.
    *   **Washing & Drying:** The precipitate is washed several times via centrifugation, collected, and dried under vacuum for 12 hours. *This yields the S MoS₂ support powder.*

2.  **Preparation of Co–S MoS₂ Catalyst:**
    *   **Formation of Co-Thiourea Complex:** 50.6 mg cobalt acetate tetrahydrate [Co(CH₃COO)₂·4H₂O] and 36 mg thiourea [SC(NH₂)₂] are added to 1 ml water. This mixture is left overnight to form the [Co(thiourea)₄]²⁺ complex.
    *   **Preparation of S MoS₂ Colloid:** A stabilized colloid is prepared by dispersing 50 mg of the *previously synthesized S MoS₂ powder* in 50 ml of a solvent mixture (30 v/v% isopropanol in water) containing 50 mg polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Concentration = 1 mg S MoS₂ per ml.
    *   **Mixing:** The entire [Co(thiourea)₄]²⁺ complex solution (from step 1) is added to the 50 ml S MoS₂ colloid and mixed to form a homogeneous solution. *Note the low Co concentration to prevent self-nucleation.*
    *   **Hydrothermal Anchoring:** The homogeneous mixture is transferred to an autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 24 hours. During this step:
        *   Thiourea ligands coordinate with sulfur vacancy sites on the S MoS₂.
        *   Cobalt atoms from the complex are delivered and anchored onto these vacancy sites.
    *   **Workup:** After reaction, the solid product is:
        *   Washed three times with deionized water.
        *   Dried under vacuum for 12 hours.
    *   **Activation:** The dried powder is treated with H₂ gas at 300 °C for 1 hour prior to storage/use. *(Likely reduces surface species and stabilizes the Co sites)*.

3.  **Preparation of F MoS₂ (Supplementary Information):**
    *   **Dispersion & Exfoliation:** 6 g bulk MoS₂ powder is dispersed in 400 ml solvent (30 v/v% isopropanol in water) with 4 ml hydrazine monohydrate (N₂H₄·H₂O).
    *   **Sonication:** The mixture is sonicated for 12 hours to exfoliate the MoS₂.
    *   **Centrifugation:** Centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 60 min to remove un-exfoliated sediment.
    *   **Neutralization & Flocculation:** HCl solution is added to the supernatant (colloid) until pH ≈ 7. This disrupts charge balance, causing rapid flocculation (precipitation) of the exfoliated F MoS₂.
    *   **Washing & Drying:** The precipitate is centrifuged, washed three times with deionized water, and dried under vacuum for 12 hours.

**Key Rationale Highlighted in Synthesis:**
*   The **very low concentration of the Co-thiourea complex** is critical to ensure Co atoms anchor directly onto S MoS₂ sulfur vacancies instead of forming separate Co or CoSₓ nanoparticles (self-nucleation).
*   The **thiourea ligands** in the complex specifically target the **sulfur vacancy sites** on the S MoS₂ support due to the high affinity of these defects for thiol-based molecules.
*   The **hydrothermal treatment** provides the energy and environment necessary for the complex to react with and fill the vacancies, anchoring the Co atoms.
