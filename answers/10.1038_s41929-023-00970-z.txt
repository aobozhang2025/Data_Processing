question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Catalyst preparation All chemical reagents were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochem- ical. The Ce 0.95 Ru 0.05 O 2 and gold-grafted Ce 0.95 Ru 0.05 O 2 catalysts were synthesized via co-precipitation followed by hydrothermal crystalliza- tion and calcination 64,65 . In the co-precipitation procedure, CeCl 3 ·7H 2 O (3.8 mmol), RuCl 3 ·nH 2 O (0.2 mmol) and HAuCl 4 ·nH 2 O (x mmol, x = 0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 or 0.6) were dissolved in deionized water (10 ml) and then added dropwise to a 7 mol l −1 NaOH solution (70 ml) under vigorous stirring to form black precipitate. After ageing for 30 min, the mixture was sealed in a 100 ml polytetrafluoroethylene-lined autoclave and hydrothermally treated at 140 °C for 48 h. Subsequently, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed several times with water and isopropanol, dried at room temperature under vacuum and ground into a fine powder. Finally, the as-synthesized catalyst was obtained by calcination of the powder under air at 400 °C for 4 h. The gold-loaded samples were denoted as Au m /Ce 0.95 Ru 0.05 O 2 (m = 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.125 or 0.15). The reference CeO 2 and Au 0.1 /CeO 2 samples were synthesized following a similar procedure. The preparation of thin catalyst layers by a screen-printing method is described in Sup- plementary Note 5.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to summarize a catalyst synthesis procedure from a technical paragraph. They're asking me to role-play as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis. 

Hmm, let me analyze this text carefully. The core catalysts being synthesized are Ce₀.₉₅Ru₀.₀₅O₂ and gold-grafted versions of it. The synthesis method involves co-precipitation → hydrothermal treatment → calcination. 

I notice the reagents are very specific: CeCl₃·7H₂O, RuCl₃·nH₂O, and HAuCl₄·nH₂O with varying molar amounts. The user probably needs exact details since they emphasized "all details". The NaOH concentration (7 mol/L) and volumes matter too - that's critical for precipitation pH control. 

*checking procedure flow* 
First step is dissolving salts in water and dripping into NaOH to form precipitate - important to note the "vigorous stirring" condition. Then aging time is 30min. Hydrothermal part is very defined: 140°C for 48h in PTFE autoclave. Post-treatment has precise washing (water + isopropanol), drying (vacuum/RT), and grinding steps. 

Ah, the calcination conditions are non-negotiable: 400°C air for 4h. The gold loading variations (m=0.05-0.15) correspond to x=0.2-0.6mmol HAuCl₄ in the table. Should explain that naming convention Auₘ/Ce₀.₉₅Ru₀.₀₅O₂. 

*mental note* Must mention the reference catalysts (pure CeO₂ and Au₀.₁/CeO₂) use same method. And the screen-printing part is supplementary - good to flag that even if not detailed. 

User likely needs this for replication or literature comparison. As a synth specialist, I should emphasize the rationale: co-precipitation ensures homogeneous mixing, hydrothermal treatment crystallizes the oxide, calcination removes volatiles/stabilizes structure. Gold grafting occurs during precipitation - clever one-pot method. 

*structuring response* 
Will organize as: 
1. Catalyst identity with formulas 
2. Synthesis route overview 
3. Detailed step-by-step 
4. Nomenclature explanation 
5. Reference samples note 
Keeping all molar amounts, temps, times exact as in text. No assumptions - if it says "nH₂O" for RuCl₃, I'll keep it that way. 

User seems knowledgeable (cites refs 64,65) so I won't dumb it down. But will clarify implied things like "x mmol" mapping to "m" values. Should warn that RuCl₃ hydration state might need verification since it's written as "nH₂O". 

Final output needs to be precise enough for lab replication. That autoclave size (100ml PTFE-lined) is actually important for scale consideration. And the vacuum drying - not oven-dried! These details prevent synthesis failures.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here is a professional summary of the synthesized catalysts and their detailed synthesis procedure:

**Synthesized Catalysts:**
1.  **Base Catalyst:** Ce₀.₉₅Ru₀.₀₅O₂ (Cerium-Ruthenium Oxide Solid Solution)
2.  **Functionalized Catalysts:** Auₘ/Ce₀.₉₅Ru₀.₀₅O₂ (Gold nanoparticles grafted onto Ce₀.₉₅Ru₀.₀₅O₂ support)
    *   Gold loadings: m = 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.125, 0.15 (molar ratio Au/(Ce+Ru))
    *   Corresponding HAuCl₄ amounts: x = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 mmol
3.  **Reference Catalysts:**
    *   CeO₂ (Pure Ceria)
    *   Au₀.₁/CeO₂ (10 mol% Au on CeO₂)

**Synthesis Procedure (Co-precipitation + Hydrothermal + Calcination):**

1.  **Solution Preparation:**
    *   Dissolve precursors in 10 ml deionized water:
        *   CeCl₃·7H₂O (3.8 mmol)
        *   RuCl₃·nH₂O (0.2 mmol)
        *   HAuCl₄·nH₂O (x mmol; x = 0 for base catalyst, x = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, or 0.6 mmol for Au-grafted catalysts)
    *   Prepare 70 ml of a 7 mol L⁻¹ NaOH solution.

2.  **Co-precipitation:**
    *   Add the metal chloride solution **dropwise** to the vigorously stirred NaOH solution.
    *   Result: Formation of a **black precipitate**.

3.  **Ageing:**
    *   Continue stirring the precipitate suspension for **30 minutes**.

4.  **Hydrothermal Crystallization:**
    *   Transfer the aged mixture to a **100 ml polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-lined autoclave**.
    *   Seal the autoclave.
    *   Heat at **140 °C** for **48 hours**.

5.  **Solid Recovery & Washing:**
    *   Collect the resulting solid precipitate by **centrifugation**.
    *   Wash the solid thoroughly **several times** with:
        *   Deionized water
        *   Isopropanol (IPA)

6.  **Drying:**
    *   Dry the washed solid **at room temperature (RT)** under **vacuum**.

7.  **Grinding:**
    *   Grind the dried solid into a **fine powder**.

8.  **Calcination:**
    *   Calcinate the fine powder under **flowing air**.
    *   Temperature: **400 °C**
    *   Duration: **4 hours**.

9.  **Final Product:**
    *   The resulting material is the **as-synthesized catalyst** (Ce₀.₉₅Ru₀.₀₅O₂ or Auₘ/Ce₀.₉₅Ru₀.₀₅O₂).

10. **Reference Catalysts:**
    *   CeO₂ and Au₀.₁/CeO₂ were synthesized using the **identical procedure** described above (steps 1-9), adjusting precursor amounts accordingly (omit Ru and Au for CeO₂; omit Ru and use HAuCl₄ for Au₀.₁/CeO₂).

**Key Details & Rationale:**

*   **One-Pot Synthesis:** Au incorporation occurs *during* the co-precipitation/hydrothermal steps, ensuring intimate contact with the Ce-Ru oxide support.
*   **Precursor States:** RuCl₃ and HAuCl₄ hydration states (`nH₂O`) are variable; exact water content should be accounted for in precise molar calculations.
*   **Precipitation Control:** Dropwise addition into concentrated NaOH (pH >14) under vigorous stirring ensures rapid and homogeneous precipitation/coprecipitation of hydroxides/oxides.
*   **Hydrothermal Treatment:** Essential for crystallizing the oxide phase (Ce₀.₉₅Ru₀.₀₅O₂) under controlled temperature/pressure, likely forming well-defined nanoparticles.
*   **Washing:** Removes soluble salts (Na⁺, Cl⁻) and other impurities. IPA wash aids in preventing particle agglomeration during drying.
*   **Vacuum Drying (RT):** Gentle removal of solvents without inducing thermal decomposition or sintering.
*   **Calcination:** Converts hydroxides/carbonates to the final oxide phase (Ce₀.₉₅Ru₀.₀₅O₂), removes residual organics, stabilizes the structure, and likely sinters Au nanoparticles onto the oxide surface. The 400°C temperature balances phase formation with preventing excessive sintering.
*   **Nomenclature:** Auₘ/Ce₀.₉₅Ru₀.₀₅O₂ directly indicates the molar ratio of Au to the (Ce+Ru) in the support (m = Au/(Ce+Ru)).

**Additional Note:**
*   The preparation of thin catalyst layers using screen-printing is referenced but not detailed in the provided text (see Supplementary Note 5).
