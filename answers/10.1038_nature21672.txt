Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Preparation of catalysts. α-MoC support. Ammonium paramolybdate ((NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 •4H 2 O) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. A grinded powder of ammonium paramolybdate was calcined in a muffle oven to 500 °C at a rate of 10 °C min −1 to synthesize the precursor MoO 3 . Then 0.8 g MoO 3 was loaded into a quartz tube reactor and placed in a vertical furnace. The powder was heated to 700 °C in NH 3 (100 ml min −1 ; pre-purified gas) at a rate of 5 °C min −1 and kept at 700 °C for 2 hours. After the sample was cooled to room temperature, the gas was then switched to a CH 4 /H 2 mixture (100 ml min −1 ; 20/80 v/v), and the temperature was increased to 700 °C at 5 °C min −1 and held at 700 °C for 2 hours. Finally, the sample was passivated at room temperature using a 0.5% O 2 /He gas mixture 29 . Elemental analysis finds that the Mo/C ratio of α -MoC is around 1/0.8. β-Mo 2 C support. β -Mo 2 C was synthesized using the same precursor as α -MoC, as follows: 0.8 g MoO 3 was loaded in the quartz tube and carburized with a CH 4 /H 2 mixture (100 ml min −1 ; 20/80 v/v), with the temperature being increased at 5 °C min −1 to 300 °C, then at 1 °C min −1 to 700 °C. After carburization at 700 °C for 2 hours, the sample was cooled to room temperature and passivated using a 0.5% O 2 /He gas mixture. 2%Pt/β-Mo 2 C catalyst. The passivated β -Mo 2 C support was transferred to a deaerated, aqueous solution containing an appropriate amount of chloroplatinic acid (H 2 PtCl 6 •6H 2 O) to achieve the desired loading. The slurry was stirred for 3 hours, dried using evaporation, and then transferred to a freeze dryer overnight to remove any moisture. Before catalytic evaluation, the catalyst was activated with a CH 4 /H 2 mixture (15/85 v/v). The activation temperature program heated the sample to 300 °C and held it there for 1 hour. The temperature was then increased to 590 °C at a rate of 5 °C min −1 and held there for another 2 hours. 2%Pt/α-MoC and 2%Pt/MoC-2 catalysts. An appropriate amount of H 2 PtCl 6 •6H 2 O was loaded onto a homemade MoO 3 support, using a wetness impregnation method. (To synthesize MoO 3 , an appropriate amount of ammonium paramo- lybdate was dissolved into pure water, adjusting the pH of the solution to 3.7. The solution underwent ultrasonication for 2 hours. The precipitates thus gener- ated were separated by evaporation of solvent and dried at 60 °C under a vacuum overnight. The precipitates were then grinded into powder and calcined in air at 500 °C for 4 hours.) After being dried at room temperature under vacuum, the sample was calcined at 500 °C for 4 hours. For Pt/α -MoC, the calcined Pt/MoO 3 was carburized using the same procedure as for the synthesis of β -Mo 2 C. For Pt/MoC-2, MoO 3 impregnated with H 2 PtCl 6 was carburized directly without calcination in air at 500 °C. 2%Pt/MoC-3 catalysts. An appropriate amount of H 2 PtCl 6 •6H 2 O aqueous solution was added into the ammonium paramolybdate solution dropwise under stirring. A yellow precipitant was thus generated. The solvent was evaporated at 90 °C and the precipitant was dried at 120 °C for 3 hours to ensure that the powder was dried 30 . Then the sample was carburized (as for β -Mo 2 C) directly to obtain 2%Pt/MoC-3. 2%Pt/Al 2 O 3 and 2%Pt/TiO 2 . These reference catalysts were synthesized using wet impregnation of H 2 PtCl 6 •6H 2 O over commercial Al 2 O 3 and TiO 2 supports 12 . The slurry was stirred for 3 hours in air to remove the liquid, using the rotary evaporator under vacuum at 35 °C. The material was dried at 120 °C for 3 hours, and then calcined in the muffle oven at 500 °C. The Pt loading is 2%. The catalysts were reduced with H 2 before catalytic evaluation. Pt/α-MoC catalysts with different Pt loadings. Pt/α -MoC catalysts with 2.2 wt%, 3.1 wt%, 5.1 wt% and 7.4 wt% Pt loadings were prepared as for Pt/α -MoC. Samples with 0.2 wt% and 0.7 wt% Pt loading were prepared using the wetness impreg- nation method with activated α -MoC as the support. The catalysts are denoted x%Pt/α -MoC, where x denotes the rough weight concentration of Pt (x = 0.2, 1, 2, 3, 5 or 7). Evaluation of catalytic performance. Before their performance was evaluated, all Pt/MoC catalysts were activated in a CH 4 /H 2 mixture (15/85 v/v) at 590 °C for 2 hours. The Pt/oxide catalysts were activated in H 2 flow at 500 °C. After being cooled to room temperature, the activated sample was transferred into de-aerated water in the autoclave under the protection of a N 2 flow. The sealed autoclave was purged using 2 MPa N 2 (10 vol% Ar was used as an internal standard) three times. The catalytic reactions were carried out at 190 °C (the pressure of the system was as high as 6 MPa), and after the reaction the gas phase was analysed using an Agilent 7820 gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). We quantified the gas-phase concentration of H 2 , CO and CH 4 ; however, we could not accurately determine the concentration of CO 2 owing to its high solubility in the liquid phase, especially at high pressures. We analysed the liquid-phase products on an Agilent HPLC 1200 using a Prevail carbohydrate ES 5-μ m column. To generate the results shown in Fig. 1d, for each cycle, the system was reacted at 190 °C for 1.25 hours. After cooling down to room temperature, the gases were analysed by gas chromatography and then released. Then the system was reheated to 190 °C
