question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Synthesis and characterization of a single-site Pt–Fe pair α-Fe 2 O 3 exposed by (012) facets is synthesized by adopting a previous method33 (see the Methods for details and Supplementary Fig. 1 for high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images). Ultralow platinum (Pt/Fe atom ratio of 1/1500) is then

Synthesis of α-Fe 2 O 3 (012) and α-Fe 2 O 3 (001). α-Fe 2 O 3 (012) and α-Fe 2 O 3 (001) were synthesized following the approach reported previously in refs. 28,33. For α-Fe 2 O 3 (012) synthesis, oleic acid (10 ml), NaOH (1.0 g) and ethanol (10 ml) were mixed by stirring at room temperature. Afterwards, ferric acetylacetonate aqueous solution (2 mmol Fe3+ in 20 ml of ultrapure water) was added to the mixed

Synthesis of a single-site Pt–Fe pair. A single-site Pt–Fe pair was synthesized using a photochemical deposition method in which H 2 PtCl 6 and methanol were used as a platinum source and sacrifice agent, respectively. Typically, 150 mg of Fe 2 O 3 (012) was suspended in a mixed solvent of 30 ml H 2 O and 10 ml methanol at room temperature. After a defined amount of H 2 PtCl 6 was added, the solution was degassed with argon gas for 30 min and then irradiated for 3 h under a xenon lamp. The catalysts were then centrifuged off, washed with water and freeze-dried.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalyst and its synthesis procedures from the provided text. Let me carefully analyze this technical information.

Hmm, the catalyst being described is a "single-site Pt-Fe pair α-Fe₂O₃ exposed by (012) facets." That's quite specific - it's hematite with platinum atoms deposited as isolated pairs with iron atoms. The Pt loading is ultralow (Pt/Fe = 1/1500), which suggests high atom efficiency.

Looking at the synthesis, it appears to be a two-step process. First, they prepare the α-Fe₂O₃ (012) support using a solution-based method. The ingredients are oleic acid (10 ml), NaOH (1.0 g), ethanol (10 ml), and ferric acetylacetonate solution (2 mmol Fe³⁺ in 20 ml water). They mix these at room temperature, though the text doesn't specify the subsequent steps - probably involves heating or aging to form the crystalline hematite with specific facet exposure.

Then comes the key Pt deposition step using photochemical deposition. They suspend 150 mg of the prepared α-Fe₂O₃ (012) in water-methanol solvent (30ml H₂O + 10ml methanol). H₂PtCl₆ is added as Pt precursor, with methanol acting as sacrificial agent. Important steps follow: degassing with argon for 30 minutes to remove oxygen, then 3 hours of irradiation under xenon lamp. Post-treatment involves centrifugation, water washing, and freeze-drying.

The user seems to need a clear, structured summary of both the catalyst composition and the detailed synthesis protocol. As a professional chemist, I should emphasize the single-site nature and facet control, which are critical for catalytic performance. I'll organize this into distinct sections about the catalyst identity and the stepwise synthesis procedures, making sure to include all technical details like concentrations, times, and processing conditions. The ultralow Pt loading deserves special mention as it's a key efficiency factor. 

I wonder if the user is preparing this for a report or presentation - they might appreciate the professional tone with precise terminology. The facet control and single-site deposition method are probably the most innovative aspects worth highlighting.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here is a professional chemist's summary of the synthesized catalyst and its detailed synthesis procedure:

**Synthesized Catalyst:**
*   **Composition:** Single-site Pt–Fe pairs supported on α-Fe₂O₃ (hematite).
*   **Support Morphology:** Hematite nanocrystals predominantly exposing the (012) crystallographic facets.
*   **Key Feature:** Ultralow Platinum loading (Pt/Fe atomic ratio = 1/1500).

**Synthesis Procedures:**

The synthesis is a **two-step process**: first synthesizing the α-Fe₂O₃ (012) support, then depositing the Pt to form single-site Pt-Fe pairs.

**1. Synthesis of α-Fe₂O₃ (012) Support (Based on refs. 28,33):**
    *   **Reagents:**
        *   Oleic acid: 10 ml
        *   Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH): 1.0 g
        *   Ethanol: 10 ml
        *   Ferric Acetylacetonate (Fe(acac)₃) aqueous solution: 2 mmol Fe³⁺ dissolved in 20 ml ultrapure water.
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Mix oleic acid (10 ml), NaOH (1.0 g), and ethanol (10 ml) together at room temperature while stirring.
        2.  Add the ferric acetylacetonate solution (2 mmol Fe³⁺ in 20 ml H₂O) to the mixture from step 1.
        3.  *(The text implies subsequent steps from the referenced methods 28,33 are followed to complete the formation of the α-Fe₂O₃ (012) crystals. This likely involves heating, aging, washing, and drying steps, but these specific details are not provided in the excerpt).*
    *   **Outcome:** α-Fe₂O₃ nanocrystals with predominantly exposed (012) facets.

**2. Synthesis of Single-Site Pt–Fe Pair Catalyst:**
    *   **Method:** Photochemical Deposition.
    *   **Reagents:**
        *   Platinum Source: Hexachloroplatinic Acid (H₂PtCl₆)
        *   Sacrificial Agent: Methanol (CH₃OH)
        *   Support: Synthesized α-Fe₂O₃ (012) (150 mg)
        *   Solvent: Mixture of Ultrapure Water (30 ml) and Methanol (10 ml)
        *   Purge Gas: Argon (Ar)
        *   Light Source: Xenon Lamp
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  **Suspension Preparation:** Suspend 150 mg of the synthesized α-Fe₂O₃ (012) support in a mixed solvent of 30 ml ultrapure water and 10 ml methanol at room temperature.
        2.  **Platinum Addition:** Add a defined amount of H₂PtCl₆ solution to the suspension. *(The amount is defined to achieve the target Pt/Fe = 1/1500 ratio)*.
        3.  **Degassing:** Purge the suspension/solution with argon gas for 30 minutes to remove dissolved oxygen.
        4.  **Photodeposition:** Irradiate the degassed mixture under a xenon lamp for 3 hours. *(Light energy drives the reduction of Pt⁴⁺ (from H₂PtCl₆) by methanol, depositing Pt atoms onto the hematite surface, specifically forming isolated Pt-Fe pair sites)*.
        5.  **Recovery:** Centrifuge the mixture to separate the solid catalyst particles from the liquid.
        6.  **Washing:** Wash the recovered solid catalyst particles thoroughly with water.
        7.  **Drying:** Freeze-dry the washed catalyst to remove water without agglomeration.

**Key Synthesis Details Emphasized:**
*   The *support synthesis* uses oleic acid, NaOH, ethanol, and Fe(acac)₃ to control the exposed (012) facet.
*   The *Pt deposition* is specifically **photochemical**, using H₂PtCl₆ as the precursor and methanol as the sacrificial reductant.
*   The reaction mixture is **rigorously degassed with Ar** before irradiation.
*   **Irradiation time** is precisely **3 hours** under a **xenon lamp**.
*   Post-reaction processing involves **centrifugation**, **water washing**, and **freeze-drying**.
*   The **Pt loading is ultralow** (Pt/Fe = 1/1500), critical for forming isolated single-site Pt-Fe pairs rather than nanoparticles.
