question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Material synthesis The nitrogen-doped carbon support was synthesized from a two-dimensional zeolitic imidazolate framework (2D-ZIF-8). The metal–organic framework was typically synthesized by dissolving 12.75 g zinc nitrate hexahydrate and 29.15 g 2-methyl imidazole separately in deionized water (DIW) (250 ml each). After mixing the two solutions, the mixture was stirred for 2 h and left still for 16 h. The resulting precipitate was filtered off, washed with DIW (3 l) and ethanol (1 l), and dried at 80 °C. The obtained 2D-ZIF-8 was mixed with KCl (20 g per g metal–organic framework), which was previ- ously dissolved in water (0.5 g ml −1 ). The water was removed in a rotary evaporator and then the solid was dried in a vacuum oven set a 80 °C. CN was obtained after carbonization at 700 °C (5 h, N 2 flow, 2 °C min −1 heating rate) and a washing treatment consisting of hydrochloric acid (2 M in water), deionized water and ethanol followed by drying at 80 °C. Pt introduction was achieved using a wet impregnation method 32 . A target amount of chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H 2 PtCl 6 .6H 2 O) was dissolved in 20 ml DIW and added to 250 mg NC. After sonication for 15 min, the water was evaporated and the powder dried at 80 °C overnight. The first annealing step was carried out at 200 °C (5 h, N 2 flow, 5 °C min −1 heating rate). The catalyst was then suspended in a 1 M NH 4 Cl solution, sonicated for 30 min and removed by centrifugation. This process was repeated twice more with the 1 M NH 4 Cl solution and three more times with DIW. After another drying step, the material was annealed a second time at 550 °C (5 h, N 2 flow, 2 °C min −1 heating rate). The Pt@PTI sample was reported in a previous study 5 , from which Pt-PTI/773 was selected for the current work. The Pt@SiO 2 sample was prepared according to the procedure reported in ref. 12. Molecular compounds were either purchased (K 2 PtCl 4 , fluorochem, 99 %; Pt(NH 3 ) 4 Cl 2 .xH 2 O, Merck, 98 %) or synthetized according to reported procedures (cis-Ptpy 2 Cl 2 ; (tmeda)PtMe 2 )

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalyst and its detailed synthesis procedure from a given paragraph. Let me carefully parse this technical text.

First, the final catalyst is platinum nanoparticles supported on nitrogen-doped carbon (Pt/NC). The support material itself is derived from a 2D zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8), which is interesting because ZIFs often create highly porous carbon structures when pyrolyzed.

Breaking down the synthesis: It starts with creating the ZIF-8 precursor by mixing zinc nitrate and 2-methylimidazole solutions. The quantities (12.75g vs 29.15g) suggest a specific molar ratio, and the aging time (16h still) likely controls crystal growth. The extensive washing (3L water + 1L ethanol) is crucial to remove unreacted precursors.

Then comes the clever step - mixing ZIF-8 with KCl before carbonization. This salt template probably prevents pore collapse during pyrolysis. The carbonization at 700°C under nitrogen converts it to N-doped carbon, with zinc evaporating away. Acid washing removes residual metals, yielding the NC support.

For platinum loading: They use wet impregnation with H₂PtCl₆ solution. The annealing at 200°C might decompose the precursor, while the NH₄Cl washing step is unusual - perhaps to remove chloride ions or control particle size. The final 550°C annealing likely activates the catalyst.

The user seems knowledgeable about chemistry, so I should maintain technical precision while organizing the steps chronologically. They probably need this for replication or comparison studies. I'll highlight critical details like heating rates and washing procedures that often affect catalyst performance. The reference to Pt@PTI and Pt@SiO₂ suggests this is part of broader catalyst screening, so clarity is essential.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, the synthesized catalyst is **Platinum nanoparticles supported on Nitrogen-doped Carbon (Pt/NC)**. The detailed synthesis procedure is as follows:

**I. Synthesis of Nitrogen-doped Carbon (NC) Support (from 2D-ZIF-8):**

1.  **Synthesis of 2D-ZIF-8 Precursor:**
    *   Dissolve 12.75 g zinc nitrate hexahydrate [Zn(NO₃)₂·6H₂O] in 250 ml deionized water (DIW).
    *   Dissolve 29.15 g 2-methylimidazole (2-MeIM) in 250 ml DIW.
    *   Mix the two solutions together.
    *   Stir the mixture for 2 hours.
    *   Let the mixture stand undisturbed for 16 hours.
    *   Filter the resulting white precipitate (2D-ZIF-8).
    *   Wash the precipitate extensively: first with 3 liters of DIW, then with 1 liter of ethanol.
    *   Dry the washed precipitate at 80 °C.

2.  **Salt Templating & Drying:**
    *   Mix the dried 2D-ZIF-8 powder with KCl at a ratio of **20 grams KCl per gram of 2D-ZIF-8**.
    *   Pre-dissolve the KCl in water to achieve a concentration of 0.5 g/ml before adding to the ZIF-8.
    *   Remove the water from the ZIF-8/KCl slurry using a **rotary evaporator**.
    *   Dry the resulting solid mixture in a **vacuum oven at 80 °C**.

3.  **Carbonization & Activation:**
    *   Carbonize the dried ZIF-8/KCl mixture under nitrogen flow (N₂) atmosphere:
        *   Temperature: 700 °C
        *   Hold time: 5 hours
        *   Heating rate: 2 °C per minute
    *   Wash the resulting carbonized material (CN) sequentially with:
        *   2 M Hydrochloric acid (HCl) in water
        *   Deionized water (DIW)
        *   Ethanol
    *   Dry the washed material at 80 °C. This final material is the **Nitrogen-doped Carbon support (NC)**.

**II. Deposition of Platinum (Pt) onto NC Support:**

4.  **Wet Impregnation:**
    *   Dissolve a target amount of chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate [H₂PtCl₆·6H₂O] (Pt precursor) in 20 ml DIW.
    *   Add this solution to 250 mg of the synthesized NC support.
    *   Sonicate the mixture for 15 minutes to ensure good dispersion.
    *   Evaporate the water.
    *   Dry the resulting powder at 80 °C overnight.

5.  **First Annealing:**
    *   Anneal the dried Pt/NC precursor under nitrogen flow (N₂):
        *   Temperature: 200 °C
        *   Hold time: 5 hours
        *   Heating rate: 5 °C per minute

6.  **Washing & Purification:**
    *   Suspend the annealed material in 1 M Ammonium Chloride (NH₄Cl) solution.
    *   Sonicate the suspension for 30 minutes.
    *   Remove the washing solution by centrifugation.
    *   **Repeat this NH₄Cl washing/sonication/centrifugation process two more times** (3 washes total with NH₄Cl).
    *   **Wash the material three more times** using DIW only (sonication/centrifugation).
    *   Dry the washed material.

7.  **Second Annealing (Activation):**
    *   Anneal the dried and washed Pt/NC material under nitrogen flow (N₂):
        *   Temperature: 550 °C
        *   Hold time: 5 hours
        *   Heating rate: 2 °C per minute

**Final Catalyst:** The material obtained after step 7 is the **Pt/NC catalyst** (Platinum nanoparticles supported on Nitrogen-doped Carbon derived from salt-templated 2D-ZIF-8).

**Key Details & Notes:**

*   **Support:** Nitrogen-doped Carbon (NC) derived from 2D-ZIF-8.
*   **Active Metal:** Platinum (Pt).
*   **Metal Precursor:** Chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H₂PtCl₆·6H₂O).
*   **Metal Deposition Method:** Wet Impregnation.
*   **Critical Steps:**
    *   **Salt Templating:** KCl addition before carbonization is crucial for pore structure development in the NC support.
    *   **Post-Carbonization Washing:** HCl wash removes residual Zn species; subsequent DIW/EtOH washes remove salts/acids.
    *   **Post-Impregnation Washing:** The NH₄Cl wash after the first annealing is a specific purification step to remove species like chloride ions.
    *   **Two-Step Annealing:** First anneal (200°C) likely decomposes the Pt precursor; second anneal (550°C) under N₂ reduces Pt and potentially enhances metal-support interaction or particle stability.
*   **Atmosphere:** All annealing steps are performed under inert N₂ gas flow.
*   **Other Materials:** The text mentions Pt@PTI and Pt@SiO₂ catalysts were used from previous studies (references 5 and 12), and molecular Pt compounds were purchased or synthesized, but these are not part of the *synthesis procedure described* for the main Pt/NC catalyst.
