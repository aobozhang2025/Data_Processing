question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Material synthesis The nitrogen-doped carbon support was synthesized from a two-dimensional zeolitic imidazolate framework (2D-ZIF-8). The metal–organic framework was typically synthesized by dissolving 12.75 g zinc nitrate hexahydrate and 29.15 g 2-methyl imidazole separately in deionized water (DIW) (250 ml each). After mixing the two solutions, the mixture was stirred for 2 h and left still for 16 h. The resulting precipitate was filtered off, washed with DIW (3 l) and ethanol (1 l), and dried at 80 °C. The obtained 2D-ZIF-8 was mixed with KCl (20 g per g metal–organic framework), which was previ- ously dissolved in water (0.5 g ml −1 ). The water was removed in a rotary evaporator and then the solid was dried in a vacuum oven set a 80 °C. CN was obtained after carbonization at 700 °C (5 h, N 2 flow, 2 °C min −1 heating rate) and a washing treatment consisting of hydrochloric acid (2 M in water), deionized water and ethanol followed by drying at 80 °C. Pt introduction was achieved using a wet impregnation method 32 . A target amount of chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H 2 PtCl 6 .6H 2 O) was dissolved in 20 ml DIW and added to 250 mg NC. After sonication for 15 min, the water was evaporated and the powder dried at 80 °C overnight. The first annealing step was carried out at 200 °C (5 h, N 2 flow, 5 °C min −1 heating rate). The catalyst was then suspended in a 1 M NH 4 Cl solution, sonicated for 30 min and removed by centrifugation. This process was repeated twice more with the 1 M NH 4 Cl solution and three more times with DIW. After another drying step, the material was annealed a second time at 550 °C (5 h, N 2 flow, 2 °C min −1 heating rate). The Pt@PTI sample was reported in a previous study 5 , from which Pt-PTI/773 was selected for the current work. The Pt@SiO 2 sample was prepared according to the procedure reported in ref. 12. Molecular compounds were either purchased (K 2 PtCl 4 , fluorochem, 99 %; Pt(NH 3 ) 4 Cl 2 .xH 2 O, Merck, 98 %) or synthetized according to reported procedures (cis-Ptpy 2 Cl 2 ; (tmeda)PtMe 2 )

reasoning: 

Alright, let me approach this systematically. The user wants me to act as a professional catalyst synthesis chemist and extract specific information from a technical paragraph. First, I need to identify the core catalyst being synthesized - that appears to be platinum nanoparticles supported on nitrogen-doped carbon (Pt/NC).

Breaking down the synthesis procedure, I notice it has three distinct phases. The first phase involves creating the nitrogen-doped carbon support from 2D-ZIF-8. This requires careful attention to precursor quantities (zinc nitrate and 2-methyl imidazole), solvent volumes, and precise aging/filtration steps. The salt-templating with KCl seems particularly important for creating the desired porous structure.

For the carbonization stage, the parameters are critical: 700°C under nitrogen with controlled heating rate, followed by acid washing to remove zinc. The user likely needs these specifics for reproducibility. Then comes the platinum loading via wet impregnation - here the H₂PtCl₆·6H₂O amount isn't specified, but the process details (sonication, evaporation, annealing) are provided.

The post-impregnation treatments stand out as unusual - that ammonium chloride washing step followed by high-temperature annealing seems designed to modify platinum particle size/distribution. I should emphasize this since it's not standard procedure.

The user mentions being a chemist, so I'll maintain technical precision while organizing the information logically. They probably need this for replication or comparison studies, hence the emphasis on "all details." I'll exclude peripheral references (Pt@PTI, Pt@SiO₂) since they're not synthesized here. The molecular compounds listed at the end also appear irrelevant to the main synthesis.

Quality control aspects are implied but not explicit - things like characterization data aren't included, so I'll note their absence. The depth suggests the user understands materials chemistry, so I won't oversimplify mechanisms but focus on reproducible steps.

answer: 

Based on the provided paragraph, here's a professional summary of the synthesized catalyst and its detailed synthesis procedure:

**Synthesized Catalyst:**
*   **Name:** Platinum supported on Nitrogen-doped Carbon (Pt/NC)
*   **Composition:** Platinum (Pt) nanoparticles dispersed on a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) support.
*   **Support Origin:** Derived from a two-dimensional Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework (2D-ZIF-8).

**Detailed Synthesis Procedure:**

1.  **Synthesis of 2D-ZIF-8 Support Precursor:**
    *   Dissolve 12.75 g Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO₃)₂·6H₂O) in 250 ml deionized water (DIW).
    *   Dissolve 29.15 g 2-Methylimidazole (2-MeIM) in 250 ml DIW.
    *   Mix the two solutions together.
    *   Stir the mixture for 2 hours.
    *   Let the mixture stand undisturbed for 16 hours (ageing).
    *   Filter the resulting white precipitate.
    *   Wash the precipitate thoroughly with DIW (3 liters total) and then ethanol (1 liter total).
    *   Dry the washed solid at 80 °C.

2.  **Preparation of NC (Nitrogen-doped Carbon) Support:**
    *   Take the dried 2D-ZIF-8 powder.
    *   Mix it with Potassium Chloride (KCl) at a ratio of **20 g KCl per 1 g of 2D-ZIF-8**. The KCl is pre-dissolved in water at a concentration of 0.5 g/ml.
    *   Remove the water using a rotary evaporator.
    *   Dry the resulting solid mixture in a vacuum oven at 80 °C.
    *   **Carbonization:** Place the dried KCl/ZIF-8 mixture in a tube furnace.
        *   Heat to 700 °C under flowing N₂ gas.
        *   Use a heating ramp rate of 2 °C per minute.
        *   Hold at 700 °C for 5 hours.
        *   Cool down (cooling rate not specified).
    *   **Washing:** Treat the carbonized material sequentially with:
        *   2 M Hydrochloric acid (HCl) in water (to remove Zn species).
        *   Deionized water (DIW) (to remove acid and salts).
        *   Ethanol (likely for final cleaning/solvent exchange).
    *   Dry the washed NC support at 80 °C.

3.  **Introduction of Platinum (Pt) via Wet Impregnation:**
    *   Dissolve a target amount (unspecified in paragraph) of Chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H₂PtCl₆·6H₂O) in 20 ml DIW.
    *   Add this solution to 250 mg of the synthesized NC support.
    *   Sonicate the mixture for 15 minutes to ensure good dispersion/impregnation.
    *   Evaporate the water.
    *   Dry the resulting powder at 80 °C overnight.

4.  **Post-Impregnation Treatment & Annealing:**
    *   **First Annealing:** Heat the dried Pt/NC precursor under flowing N₂ gas.
        *   Heat to 200 °C.
        *   Use a heating ramp rate of 5 °C per minute.
        *   Hold at 200 °C for 5 hours.
        *   Cool down (cooling rate not specified).
    *   **Washing:**
        *   Suspend the annealed material in 1 M Ammonium Chloride (NH₄Cl) solution.
        *   Sonicate for 30 minutes.
        *   Separate the solid by centrifugation. Discard the supernatant.
        *   **Repeat** this NH₄Cl washing/sonication/centrifugation process **two more times** (3 washes total with 1 M NH₄Cl).
        *   **Then wash** the solid with DIW using the same sonication/centrifugation process **three times**.
    *   Dry the washed solid again.
    *   **Second Annealing:** Heat the dried material under flowing N₂ gas.
        *   Heat to 550 °C.
        *   Use a heating ramp rate of 2 °C per minute.
        *   Hold at 550 °C for 5 hours.
        *   Cool down (cooling rate not specified).

**Key Synthesis Features:**
*   **Support:** Uses sacrificial templating (KCl) during ZIF-8 carbonization to shape the NC support.
*   **Doping:** Nitrogen doping originates from the organic linker (2-MeIM) in the ZIF-8 precursor.
*   **Metal Loading:** Employs standard wet impregnation using H₂PtCl₆.
*   **Unique Step:** Includes an unusual post-annealing wash with NH₄Cl solution after the first low-temperature anneal, likely to remove loosely bound species or chlorides before the final high-temperature anneal.
*   **Thermal Treatment:** Uses a two-step annealing process (200°C then 550°C) under inert atmosphere (N₂) to reduce Pt and stabilize the nanoparticles on the NC support.

**Note:** The paragraph mentions Pt@PTI and Pt@SiO₂ samples but specifies they were prepared according to other references, not synthesized in the described procedure. The molecular compounds listed at the end (K₂PtCl₄, Pt(NH₃)₄Cl₂·xH₂O, cis-Ptpy₂Cl₂, (tmeda)PtMe₂) are precursors or references for other syntheses, not part of this specific Pt/NC catalyst synthesis. The core catalyst synthesized here is Pt/NC derived from KCl-templated 2D-ZIF-8 carbon.
