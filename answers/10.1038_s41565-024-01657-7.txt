question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Synthesis of catalysts BLG (>98%) was purchased from Davisco Foods International and puri- fied using a previously reported protocol 50 . For a detailed description of BLG fibril preparation, see ref. 51. For the synthesis of Fe SA @FibBLG, 100 mg lyophilized BLG fibril powder was dispersed in a mixture of 8.0 ml ethanol and 1.9 ml PEG200. The dispersion was then subjected to argon bubbling for 30 min to remove the dissolved oxygen, followed by irradiation under a xenon lamp with an ultraviolet filter (250–380 nm, 27.9 mW cm −2 , PLS-SXE300CUV) for 10 min to generate free radicals. Subsequently, 0.1 ml of 108.21 mg ml −1 Fe(NO 3 ) 3 ·9H 2 O EDTA solution was added dropwise to the dispersion of BLG fibrils under magnetic stirring for 12 h at 25 °C. Fe SA @BLG was prepared by the same synthe- sis procedure as for Fe SA @FibBLG, except that the BLG fibril powder was replaced by an equal amount of BLG powder. For the synthesis of FeNP@FibBLG, the as-obtained Fe SA @FibBLG dispersion was further ultraviolet-irradiated for 18 min under anaerobic conditions to reduce the iron ions. Finally, samples were collected by centrifugation at 4 °C, 11,100g for 10 min, washed by ethanol (10.0 ml × 6) and resuspended in 5.0 ml deionized water (pH 2). The powdered Fe SA @FibBLG, Fe SA @BLG and FeNP@FibBLG were obtained by lyophilization and stored at 4 °C.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to summarize the catalyst synthesis details from a technical paragraph as if I were a professional chemist specializing in catalysts. Let me carefully parse this information.

First, I notice the paragraph describes three catalysts: Fe SA @FibBLG, Fe SA @BLG, and FeNP@FibBLG. The core difference lies in the protein support structure and iron speciation. The user seems to need a clear breakdown of procedures - probably for replication or understanding design principles.

Hmm, the key materials are BLG (beta-lactoglobulin) from Davisco, purified using established methods. Interesting choice - whey proteins make sustainable catalyst supports. The synthesis involves several precise steps: dispersion in ethanol/PEG200, argon degassing, UV radical generation, iron chelate addition, and optional reduction step for nanoparticles.

I should highlight the critical parameters: argon bubbling time (30 min), UV intensity (27.9 mW/cm²), stirring duration (12h), and the EDTA-chelated iron precursor. The centrifugation specs (11,100g at 4°C) and washing protocol (6x ethanol) are crucial for reproducibility. 

Wait - the pH 2 resuspension is unusual. Most proteins denature at low pH, but here it's likely stabilizing the iron species. Must mention lyophilization for powder storage too. 

The user might be comparing single-atom vs nanoparticle catalysts, so I'll emphasize how UV reduction converts Fe SA @FibBLG to FeNP@FibBLG. The identical procedures except for support (fibrils vs native protein) and reduction step need clear differentiation.

Better organize chronologically: start with support prep, then synthesis steps for each catalyst, isolation methods. Should flag that references 50/51 contain purification/fibril details not repeated here. 

Noticing anaerobic conditions during reduction - important for preventing oxidation. The EDTA chelation probably controls iron coordination. Professional chemists would appreciate these design rationales. 

Final output needs: 1) Catalyst definitions 2) Step-by-step synthesis 3) Critical parameters 4) Isolation/storage. Avoid jargon but maintain technical precision - user is likely a researcher.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here's a professional summary of the catalysts synthesized and their detailed procedures:

**Catalysts Synthesized:**

1.  **Fe SA @FibBLG:** Single-atom iron sites supported on fibrillated Beta-Lactoglobulin (BLG).
2.  **Fe SA @BLG:** Single-atom iron sites supported on native (non-fibrillated) Beta-Lactoglobulin (BLG).
3.  **FeNP@FibBLG:** Iron nanoparticles supported on fibrillated Beta-Lactoglobulin (BLG).

**Synthesis Procedures (Detailed):**

1.  **Starting Material Preparation:**
    *   Beta-Lactoglobulin (BLG, >98%) was purchased from Davisco Foods International.
    *   The purchased BLG was purified using a previously reported method (Ref. 50).
    *   BLG fibrils (FibBLG) were prepared according to a reported protocol (Ref. 51).
    *   Both purified native BLG powder and lyophilized BLG fibril powder were used as supports.

2.  **Synthesis of Fe SA @FibBLG & Fe SA @BLG (Single-Atom Catalysts):**
    *   **Step 1: Dispersion & Deoxygenation:** 100 mg of lyophilized BLG fibril powder (for Fe SA @FibBLG) *or* lyophilized native BLG powder (for Fe SA @BLG) was dispersed in a mixture of 8.0 ml ethanol and 1.9 ml polyethylene glycol (PEG200).
    *   **Step 2: Oxygen Removal:** The dispersion was bubbled with Argon gas for 30 minutes to remove dissolved oxygen.
    *   **Step 3: Radical Generation:** The deoxygenated dispersion was irradiated under a Xenon lamp equipped with an ultraviolet filter (transmitting 250–380 nm light, intensity 27.9 mW cm⁻², model PLS-SXE300CUV) for 10 minutes. This generates free radicals on the protein support.
    *   **Step 4: Iron Precursor Addition:** 0.1 ml of an aqueous Fe(NO₃)₃·9H₂O EDTA solution (concentration: 108.21 mg ml⁻¹) was added dropwise to the dispersion under magnetic stirring.
    *   **Step 5: Complexation/Adsorption:** The mixture was stirred magnetically for 12 hours at 25 °C to allow coordination/adsorption of the iron-EDTA complex onto the radical sites of the protein support, forming the single-atom catalysts.

3.  **Synthesis of FeNP@FibBLG (Nanoparticle Catalyst):**
    *   **Step 1: Start from Fe SA @FibBLG:** The Fe SA @FibBLG dispersion (obtained after Step 5 above) was used as the starting material.
    *   **Step 2: Iron Reduction:** This dispersion was further irradiated under the same Xenon lamp/UV filter setup (250–380 nm, 27.9 mW cm⁻²) for 18 minutes under anaerobic conditions (maintained to prevent oxidation). This UV photoreduction step converts the single-atom iron species into iron nanoparticles on the fibril support.

4.  **Isolation, Washing, and Storage (Common to all Catalysts):**
    *   **Collection:** The catalyst particles were collected by centrifugation at 4 °C and 11,100 x g (relative centrifugal force) for 10 minutes.
    *   **Washing:** The pellet was washed thoroughly with ethanol (10.0 ml per wash, repeated 6 times) to remove unreacted precursors and by-products.
    *   **Resuspension:** The washed pellet was resuspended in 5.0 ml of deionized water adjusted to pH 2.
    *   **Drying:** The aqueous suspension was lyophilized (freeze-dried) to obtain the catalyst as a powder.
    *   **Storage:** The powdered catalysts (Fe SA @FibBLG, Fe SA @BLG, FeNP@FibBLG) were stored at 4 °C.

**Key Distinctions:**

*   **Fe SA @FibBLG vs. Fe SA @BLG:** The synthesis procedure is identical *except* that Fe SA @FibBLG uses **fibrillated BLG powder** as the support, while Fe SA @BLG uses **native (non-fibrillated) BLG powder**.
*   **FeNP@FibBLG vs. Fe SA @FibBLG:** FeNP@FibBLG is synthesized by taking the freshly made **Fe SA @FibBLG dispersion** and subjecting it to an **additional 18 minutes of UV irradiation** under anaerobic conditions to reduce the iron atoms to nanoparticles. Fe SA @FibBLG itself is synthesized *without* this reduction step.
