question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Catalyst preparation. All the chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. CeO 2 nanorods were prepared according to a procedure reported elsewhere35,36. The synthesis scheme is depicted in Supplementary Fig. 1a. In brief, 25 g of NaOH (reagent grade ≥98%) was dissolved in 30 ml of demineralized water. A solution of 2.17 g of Ce(NO 3 )∙6H 2 O (99% purity) in 5 ml of demineralized water was prepared. Subsequently, the two solutions were poured together, and the obtained slurry was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. Next, the volume was increased to ~100 ml by adding demineralized water and the slurry was transferred into a 125 ml Teflon liner. This liner was then sealed in a stainless-steel autoclave, which was placed in an oven for 24 h at 100 °C. After cooling in a water bath, the obtained precipitate was washed with five cycles of centrifugation, decantation and redispersion until a pH of ~7–8 was obtained. The resulting solid was dried in a vacuum oven for 2 h at 80 °C and then calcined in air at 500 °C. Subsequently, a Pd wet impregnation of CeO 2 nanorods using Pd(NO 3 )∙2H 2 O as the Pd precursor was performed. An appropriate amount of Pd salt was dissolved in demineralized water (10 ml) and poured onto the calcined CeO 2 powder. The resulting mixture was vigorously stirred for 30 min at room temperature and then slowly heated to evaporate the water without boiling. The obtained solid was dried overnight at 110 °C and subsequently calcined in air at 300 °C. The calcined samples were denoted as 1PdRods and 5PdRods, depending on the intended Pd loading. The FSP synthesis was performed using a commercial TETHIS NPS10 apparatus. The principal scheme of the synthesis set-up can be found in Supplementary Fig. 1b. The precursor solution was prepared by dissolving Ce(acac)∙H 2 O (99.9% purity) and Pd(acac) 2 ∙H 2 O (99% purity) salts (acac, acetylacetone) in glacial acetic acid (99.7% purity), which gave rise to a 0.1 M Ce precursor solution, and the Pd molarity was varied to target a particular Pd loading. To increase the solubility of the salts, the solution was heated slightly to ~50 °C and stirred for 0.5 h. The fully transparent solution was then transferred into the syringe of the FSP set-up. The solution was injected at a feed rate of 5 ml min−1 into the methane/oxygen flame (1.5 l min−1 of methane and 3.0 l min−1 of oxygen). An oxygen flow of 5.0 l min−1 was used for the dispersion of the solution, which gave rise to an overpressure at the nozzle of ~2.5 bar. On pyrolysis in the flame, the NPs were formed and deposited on the quartz fibre filter in the upper part of the set-up (Supplementary Fig. 1). The powders collected from the filter were denoted as 1PdFSP and 5PdFSP, depending on the intended Pd loading.

reasoning: 

Alright, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis. They need a detailed summary of the catalysts synthesized and their procedures from the provided paragraph. Let me start by breaking down the text.

First, I notice two main methods: hydrothermal synthesis for CeO2 nanorods followed by wet impregnation for Pd loading, and flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) for direct Pd-CeO2 synthesis. The user probably needs clarity on both processes separately. 

Looking at the hydrothermal method, they dissolve NaOH and cerium nitrate, mix them, and then use an autoclave. After washing and calcination, they add Pd via impregnation. The final catalysts are named 1PdRods and 5PdRods based on Pd loading. For FSP, they dissolve cerium and Pd acetylacetonates in acetic acid, inject into a flame, and collect the powder as 1PdFSP and 5PdFSP. 

I should ensure all steps are covered without missing details like concentrations, temperatures, washing steps, or equipment. The user might be a researcher replicating the synthesis, so precision is key. They might also care about the differences between the two methods—hydrothermal gives nanorods while FSP produces mixed oxides. 

Also, the mention of Supplementary Fig. 1 suggests visual aids, but since they're not provided, I should describe the setups based on the text. The FSP part is repeated, so I need to avoid redundancy. 

Potential deeper needs: The user might be comparing synthesis methods for catalyst performance or scalability. Highlighting the distinct structures (nanorods vs. mixed oxides) could be important for their application. They might also need the specific Pd loadings clarified, though exact percentages aren't given. 

I should structure the summary by method, listing materials, steps, and resulting catalysts. Emphasize critical parameters like pH control in washing, calcination temperatures, and FSP flow rates. Mentioning the naming conventions (PdRods vs. PdFSP) will help differentiate the catalysts. 

Check if all chemicals and their purities are included. Also, note that the FSP uses a commercial apparatus, which might affect reproducibility. Make sure to explain terms like wet impregnation and pyrolysis for clarity. 

Finally, confirm that both synthesis routes are covered comprehensively, and the catalysts are clearly identified with their preparation methods and intended Pd loadings.
