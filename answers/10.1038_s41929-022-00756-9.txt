question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Synthesis of single Pt atoms on Ru nanoparticles. In a typical synthesis, faceted Ru branched nanoparticles (0.1 mmol)18 and oleylamine (1 mmol, Sigma-Aldrich, 70%) were dispersed in 5.0 ml 1-octadecene (Sigma-Aldrich, 90 %) in a 25 ml two-necked round-bottomed flask. The solution was heated at 180 °C for 30 min under a nitrogen flow. Platinum(II) acetylacetonate (0.025 mmol, Sigma-Aldrich, 97%) was dissolved in 2 ml benzyl ether (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) and slowly injected into the Ru solution at a rate of 0.2 ml min−1. The reaction was kept at 180 °C for 1 h. The synthesized nanoparticles were purified by precipitation using a mixture of toluene and ethanol and centrifuging at 1,500 r.p.m. for 5 min. The nanoparticles were then loaded on 10 mg Vulcan XC carbon (Fuel Cell Store) in 10 ml hexane and the mixture was stirred overnight. The products were collected by centrifugation and stored in a vial. The carbon-loaded PtRu branched nanoparticles were heated under a 5% hydrogen/nitrogen gas mixture at 200 °C for 2 h. The amount of Pt was analysed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) by digesting samples in aqua regia for 1 h at 80 °C.

reasoning: 

Alright, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalyst and its synthesis procedure from the provided paragraph. Let me start by carefully reading the paragraph to extract all the necessary details.

First, the catalyst being synthesized is single platinum (Pt) atoms supported on ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles. The support structure is faceted Ru branched nanoparticles. The goal is to achieve atomically dispersed Pt on Ru, which is crucial for catalytic properties like high activity and selectivity.

Looking at the synthesis steps, the procedure begins with dispersing Ru nanoparticles and oleylamine in 1-octadecene. The mixture is heated under nitrogen at 180°C for 30 minutes. This step likely conditions the Ru surface and removes impurities. 

Next, Pt precursor (platinum(II) acetylacetonate) dissolved in benzyl ether is slowly injected at a controlled rate. The slow injection is key to ensure controlled deposition of Pt atoms without forming clusters. Maintaining the temperature at 180°C for an hour allows the Pt to deposit as single atoms on the Ru nanoparticles.

Purification involves precipitation using toluene and ethanol, followed by centrifugation. Loading the nanoparticles onto Vulcan XC carbon support in hexane with overnight stirring ensures proper dispersion on the carbon. After centrifugation, the material is treated under a hydrogen/nitrogen mixture at 200°C. This reduction step likely removes any residual organic ligands and activates the catalyst.

Finally, Pt loading is quantified using ICP-OES after digesting samples in aqua regia. This confirms the amount of Pt deposited.

I need to ensure all steps, reagents, quantities, temperatures, and times are accurately captured. The user might be a researcher or student needing precise details for replication. They might also be interested in the rationale behind each step, like nitrogen flow preventing oxidation or slow injection for atomic dispersion. Highlighting these aspects could address deeper needs for understanding synthesis optimization and catalyst design principles.

Based on the provided text, here's a professional chemist's summary of the synthesized catalyst and its detailed synthesis procedure:

**Synthesized Catalyst:**
*   **Catalyst:** Platinum Single Atoms (Pt SA) supported on faceted Ruthenium Branched Nanoparticles (Ru NPs), subsequently loaded onto Vulcan XC carbon.
*   **Key Feature:** Pt is atomically dispersed on the Ru nanoparticle surface, not forming clusters or nanoparticles of its own.

    *   **Equipment:** 25 ml two-necked round-bottom flask.
    *   **Procedure:** Disperse the Ru nanoparticles and oleylamine in 1-octadecene within the flask. Heat the solution to 180 °C under a continuous flow of nitrogen gas. Maintain this temperature for 30 minutes.

2.  **Preparation & Injection of Pt Precursor:**
    *   **Materials:** Platinum(II) acetylacetonate (Pt(acac)₂, 0.025 mmol, 97%), Benzyl ether (2 ml, 98%).
    *   **Procedure:** Dissolve the Pt(acac)₂ in benzyl ether. Slowly inject this Pt solution into the *hot* Ru dispersion (maintained at 180 °C) at a controlled rate of **0.2 ml per minute**.

5.  **Carbon Support Loading:**
    *   **Materials:** Vulcan XC carbon (10 mg), Hexane (10 ml).
    *   **Procedure:** Disperse the purified PtRu nanoparticles in 10 ml hexane. Add 10 mg Vulcan XC carbon to this dispersion. Stir the mixture vigorously **overnight** to allow adsorption of the PtRu nanoparticles onto the carbon support.

6.  **Isolation of Carbon-Loaded Catalyst:**
    *   **Procedure:** Collect the carbon-loaded PtRu nanoparticles by centrifugation. Transfer the solid product to a storage vial.

7.  **Thermal Activation (Reduction):**
    *   **Conditions:** Heat the carbon-loaded PtRu nanoparticles under a flowing gas mixture of **5% Hydrogen (H₂) in Nitrogen (N₂)**.

**Key Synthesis Rationale Highlights:**
*   **Oleylamine:** Acts as a surfactant/stabilizer and likely a mild reducing agent.
*   **1-Octadecene/Benzyl Ether:** High-boiling solvents enabling high-temperature reaction.
*   **N₂ Flow:** Creates an inert atmosphere preventing oxidation.
*   **Slow Pt Injection:** Critical for controlled deposition, favoring single-atom formation over nucleation/growth of Pt particles.
*   **Carbon Loading:** Provides a conductive support for electrocatalytic applications and prevents nanoparticle aggregation.
*   **H₂/N₂ Treatment:** Reduces surface oxides on the metals and removes residual organic ligands (capping agents), activating the catalyst surface.
