question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Synthesis and pretreatment. The 0.0025% SAC was prepared by wet impregnation. The MgAl 2 O 4 support (Puralox MG 28, Sasol) was calcined at 500 °C for 4 h before impregnation. Deionized water (20 ml) was added to a Pyrex bottle and the pH was adjusted with nitric acid to 2.8. The Ir nitrate precursor (8.7 wt% Ir, Furuya Metal Co.) was added into the pH-adjusted solution. The MgAl 2 O 4 support was then added into the solution while stirring. The final pH of the solution was 9.5. The nominal Ir weight loading was 0.0025%. After 12 h of stirring, the solution was filtered out and the solid sample was dried in air for 24 h at room temperature. The sample was then dried at 80 °C and 100 °C before calcination at 500 °C for 4 h. The Ir in the solution after filtration was measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and no Ir was detected. The 1% Ir/MgAl 2 O 4 samples were synthesized by incipient impregnation. The proper amount of Ir nitrate precursor was added to the MgAl 2 O 4 support (Puralox MG30, Sasol) drop by drop, and the sample was then dried at 80 °C and 100 °C (at 0.5 °C min−1) for 4 h respectively. The dried sample was then calcined at 500 °C in air for 4 h. The 0.2% Ir/MgA 2 O 4 NP sample was prepared by wet impregnation. The proper amount of Ir(CO) 2 (acac) (Sigma Aldrich) precursor was dissolved in 8 ml of toluene (Sigma Aldrich) in a 20 ml vial while flowing N 2 at room temperature. Then the dissolved Ir(CO) 2 (acac) toluene solution was injected into another vial containing 5 g MgAl 2 O 4 (Puralox MG 28, Sasol) under N 2 flow. The sample was then dried under N 2 flow at room temperature overnight to evaporate the toluene. No calcination was performed on this catalyst. The CO and acac ligands were removed in situ by treatment in H 2 at 500 °C, which led to the formation of 1 nm NPs as detailed in the Results. All of the in situ characterizations and the CO oxidation reaction followed the same pretreatment procedure. For the Ir SAC, the sample was calcined in 5 kPa O 2 (certified grade, Airgas) at 100 °C for 30 min (1 °C min−1 ramp rate) and 400 °C for 30 min (5 °C min−1 ramp rate). The calcined sample was then pretreated in He (99.999% Airgas) at 650 °C for 30 min with a 15 °C min−1 ramp rate. The temperature was then cooled in He to 110 °C and purged for 10 min before switching to 20 kPa H 2 (balance He). The sample was then reduced in H 2 (99.999% Airgas) at 500 °C (15 °C min−1 ramp rate) for 2 h. After reduction, He was used to flush the H 2 at 650 °C for 30 min followed by cooling down in He to 35 °C. For the 1% Ir catalyst, after calcination at 500 °C, the catalyst was reduced in 20 kPa H 2 at 800 °C (15 °C min−1) for 2 h followed by flushing with He for 30 min at the same temperature and then cooling down in He to 35 °C. The 0.2% Ir/MgA 2 O 4 NP sample (prepared with Ir(CO) 2 (acac) precursor) was pretreated with 20 kPa H 2 at 500 °C (10 °C min−1 ramp rate) for 2 h to remove the CO and acac ligands and then cooled down in 20% H 2 to room temperature and then purged with He for 10 min.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to summarize catalyst synthesis procedures from a technical paragraph. They're posing as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis, so I need to deliver a precise, technically accurate response. 

First, I identify three distinct catalysts described: a 0.0025% Ir SAC (single-atom catalyst), a 1% Ir/MgAl₂O₄, and a 0.2% Ir/MgAl₂O₄ NP (nanoparticle catalyst). Each has unique synthesis and pretreatment steps. 

For the SAC: The wet impregnation method stands out - they carefully adjusted pH to 2.8 before adding Ir nitrate, then the support addition shifted pH to 9.5. That pH swing likely facilitates single-atom dispersion. The ICP-AES confirmation showing no Ir in filtrate is crucial - proves near-total Ir uptake. The pretreatment involves complex oxidation/reduction cycles; I should emphasize the 650°C He treatment which probably stabilizes single atoms. 

The 1% Ir sample is simpler - incipient impregnation without pH control. But its reduction at 800°C is extreme! That must sinter particles intentionally. Should contrast this with SAC's milder treatment. 

The NP catalyst is interesting - organic precursor (Ir(CO)₂(acac)) in toluene under inert atmosphere. No calcination, just H₂ reduction to decompose ligands. The in situ nanoparticle formation at 500°C is key - they got 1nm particles. 

User probably needs this for lab replication or comparison studies. I'll structure by catalyst type, highlight critical steps (pH, atmosphere, temperature ramps), and note characterization validations like ICP-AES and particle size. Must distinguish SAC vs NP formation mechanisms clearly - that's the core science here. 

Oh, and watch typos: "MgA₂O₄" in original text is clearly "MgAl₂O₄". Will correct silently. Also clarify that "SAC" means single-atom catalyst upfront. 

The pretreatments are as important as syntheses - those conditions define active sites. I'll separate synthesis from activation protocols for readability. User seems experienced (they used "SAC" casually), so no need to explain basic terms like calcination.
