Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Preparation of PdCl 2 /UiO-66-NH 2 @Fe-TiPP and yolk–shells Pd 1 @Fe, Fe 1 @ Pd 1 , Pd 1 @CN and CN@Fe 1 . First, α,α′-dibromo-p-xylene (18 mg) was dissolved in 20 ml of DMF to form a clear solution, which was subsequently added into 40 ml of DMF that contained the as-prepared Fe-TiPP (10 mg), TiPP (20 mg) and PdCl 2 /UiO-66-NH 2 @SiO 2 (60 mg) under robust stirring at room temperature. The mixed suspension was then transferred into a 100 ml round-bottomed flask kept at 110 °C for 24 h. The obtained product was separated by centrifugation and washed subsequently with DMF three times and ethanol twice, and finally dried at 70 °C under vacuum overnight. Next, the collected solid powder (core–shell–shell PdCl 2 / UiO-66-NH 2 @Fe-TiPP) was placed in a tube furnace and heated to 700 °C for 3 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 under flowing N 2 gas and then naturally cooled to room temperature to obtain the representative samples. The obtained samples were etched in a 1 M NaOH aqueous solution at room temperature for 24 h to remove the SiO 2 template to give the final yolk–shell Pd 1 @Fe 1 catalyst. The same procedure was utilized for the synthesis of yolk–shell Fe 1 @Pd 1 via reversing the order of addition of Pd and Fe. The PdCl 2 /UiO-66-NH 2 @SiO 2 @TiPP was prepared by coating the pure TiPP polymer, followed by heat treatment and removal of the SiO 2 template to generate yolk–shell Pd 1 @CN. The UiO-66-NH 2 @SiO 2 @Fe-TiPP was utilized for the synthesis of yolk–shell CN@Fe 1 via heat treatment and removal of the SiO 2 template. The core–shell Pd 1 @Fe 1 catalyst was directly prepared by the pyrolysis of PdCl 2 /UiO-66-NH 2 @Fe-TiPP.

Preparation of PdCl 2 /UiO-66-NH 2 . The Pd precursor (PdCl 2 ) was adsorbed through unsaturated dangling –NH 2 groups by wet impregnation. Briefly, a mixed precursor of ZrCl 4 (315 mg) and PdCl 2 /H 2 BDC-NH 2 (5.6 mg/245 mg) was dissolved in 300 ml of DMF that contained 36 ml of glacial acetic acid in a 500 ml round-bottomed flask. The mixture was treated with ultrasound for 0.5 h to form a homogeneous transparent solution. Then, the mixture was heated at 120 °C for 3 h and then cooled to room temperature. The as-obtained products were centrifuged at 7,000 r.p.m. for 3 min and washed with methanol and DMF (1/4 v/v) three times. Finally, the as-prepared PdCl 2 /UiO-66-NH 2 was dried in vacuum at 65 °C overnight.

Preparation of hollow Pd 1 &Fe 1 . To synthesize hollow Pd 1 &Fe 1 , the SiO 2 spheres was first prepared via the classical Stöber method. Absolute ethanol (300 ml), deionized water (100 ml) and 28% NH 3 ·H 2 O (15 ml) were mixed and stirred. A total of 12 ml of TEOS was quickly added to the mixture. After a reaction time of about 60 min, the silica spheres were isolated by centrifugation. Then, α,α′-dibromo-p-xylene (40 mg) was dissolved in 20 ml of DMF to form a clear solution, which was subsequently added to 20 ml of DMF that contained the as-prepared Fe-TiPP (14 mg), Pd-TiPP (14 mg) and SiO 2 (40 mg) under robust stirring at room temperature. The mixed suspension was then transferred into a 100 ml round-bottomed flask and kept at 110 °C for 24 h. The obtained product was separated by centrifugation and washed subsequently with DMF three times and ethanol twice, and finally dried at 70 °C under vacuum overnight. Finally, the collected solid powder was placed in a tube furnace and heated to 700 °C for 3 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 under flowing N 2 gas and then naturally cooled to room temperature. Then, the obtained samples were etched in a 1 M NaOH aqueous solution at room temperature for 24 h to remove the SiO 2 spheres to obtain the hollow Pd 1 &Fe 1 catalyst.

Preparation of hollow Pd 1 @Fe 1 . For the synthesis of the hollow Pd 1 @Fe 1 catalyst, α,α′-dibromo-p-xylene (40 mg) was dissolved in 20 ml of DMF to form a clear solution, which was subsequently added to 20 ml of DMF that contained the as-prepared TiPP (14 mg), Pd-TiPP (14 mg) and SiO 2 (40 mg) under robust stirring at room temperature. The mixed suspension was then transferred into a 100 ml round-bottomed flask at 110 °C for 24 h. The obtained SiO 2 @Pd-TiPP was separated by centrifugation and washed subsequently with DMF three times and ethanol twice, and finally dried at 70 °C under vacuum overnight. Then, the as-prepared SiO 2 @Pd-TiPP (60 ml, 1 mg ml−1) was dissolved in a mixed solution that contained ethyl alcohol (6 ml), cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (160 mg) and NaOH solution (0.5 ml) under ultrasonication for 0.5 h. Then, TEOS (0.4 ml) was added to this suspension and stirred for 2 h at 60 °C. The three-layer core– shell–shell SiO 2 @Pd-TiPP@SiO 2 was collected and washed three times with ethyl alcohol, after which the core–shell–shell SiO 2 @Pd-TiPP@SiO 2 (50 mg) was further dissolved in 20 ml of DMF that contained TiPP (20 mg) and Fe-TiPP (20 mg) to form a homogeneous solution. Then, α,α′-dibromo-p-xylene (60 ml, 1 mg ml−1) was added to the above suspension and stirred for 24 h at 110 °C. Finally, the collected solid powder was placed in a tube furnace and heated to 700 °C for 3 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 under flowing N 2 gas and then naturally cooled to room temperature. Then obtained samples were etched in 1 M NaOH aqueous solution at room temperature for 24 h to remove the SiO 2 template to obtain the hollow Pd 1 @Fe 1 catalyst.

Preparation of UiO-66-NH 2 . In a typical procedure, a mixture of ZrCl 4 (315 mg) and H 2 BDC-NH 2 (245 mg) was dissolved in 300 ml of DMF that contained 40 ml of glacial acetic acid into a 500 ml round-bottomed flask. The mixture was treated with ultrasound for 0.5 h to form a homogeneous transparent solution. Then, the mixture was heated at 120 °C for 3 h and cooled to room temperature. The as-obtained products were centrifuged at 7,000 r.p.m. for 3 min and washed with methanol and DMF (1/4 v/v) three times. Finally, the as-prepared UiO-66-NH 2 was dried under vacuum at 65 °C for further use.

Preparation of core–shells PdCl 2 /UiO-66-NH 2 @SiO 2 and UiO-66-NH 2 @SiO 2 . The as-prepared PdCl 2 /UiO-66-NH 2 (60 ml, 1 mg ml−1) was first dissolved in a mixed solution that contained ethyl alcohol (6 ml), cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (160 mg) and NaOH solution (0.3 ml, 2 M) under ultrasonication for 0.5 h.

reasoning: 

Alright, let me approach this query systematically. The user wants a chemist's summary of catalyst synthesis procedures from a detailed technical paragraph. 

First, I need to identify all catalysts mentioned: Pd₁@Fe₁, Fe₁@Pd₁, Pd₁@CN, CN@Fe₁, hollow Pd₁&Fe₁, hollow Pd₁@Fe₁, and core-shell Pd₁@Fe₁. The key materials involved are PdCl₂/UiO-66-NH₂, Fe-TiPP, TiPP, and SiO₂ templates.

The synthesis follows a pattern: 
1) Template preparation (SiO₂ spheres or MOF composites)
2) Polymer coating using α,α'-dibromo-p-xylene as linker 
3) High-temperature pyrolysis (700°C under N₂)
4) SiO₂ removal with NaOH etching

For yolk-shell structures like Pd₁@Fe₁, the critical step is the core-shell-shell precursor (PdCl₂/UiO-66-NH₂@Fe-TiPP) formation before pyrolysis. The order reversal for Fe₁@Pd₁ suggests precise spatial control matters. 

The hollow catalysts use similar methods but with different core materials. The detailed etching conditions (1M NaOH, 24h RT) are noteworthy as they preserve the metal structures while removing silica.

I notice the MOF synthesis (UiO-66-NH₂) uses standard solvothermal methods with acetic acid modulator. The Pd incorporation via -NH₂ groups indicates targeted metal anchoring.

For the response, I'll organize catalysts by structure type (yolk-shell, hollow, core-shell) and highlight:
- Precursor compositions
- Critical reaction parameters (temp, time, atmosphere)
- Template removal specifics
- Any order-dependent variations

The user seems knowledgeable based on the query phrasing, so I'll maintain technical precision while ensuring clarity. The mention of "all details" suggests including quantities and conditions, which I'll present concisely in bullet points.

**Key Synthesis Strategies:**
1.  **Polymer Coating:** α,α′-Dibromo-p-xylene links metalloporphyrin polymers (Fe-TiPP, Pd-TiPP, TiPP) around templates (SiO₂, MOF@SiO₂) at 110°C in DMF.

3.  **Template Removal:** Selective etching of SiO₂ cores or interlayers using 1 M NaOH at RT for 24h creates yolk-shell or hollow structures.
4.  **Order Control:** The sequence of polymer coating and the type of core template determine the final catalyst architecture (yolk-shell, hollow, core-shell) and composition (Pd₁@Fe₁, Fe₁@Pd₁, Pd₁@CN, etc.).
5.  **MOF Functionalization:** PdCl₂ loaded onto UiO-66-NH₂ via coordination to unsaturated -NH₂ groups during MOF synthesis (wet impregnation).
