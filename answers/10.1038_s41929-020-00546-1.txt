question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Synthesis of Co(acac) 3 @ZIF-8 precursors. Co(acac) 3 @ZIF-8 precursors with different Co contents were synthesized by varying the Co(acac) 3 amount against mIm in a certain volume of methanol during the ZIF-8 formation (mass ratios of Co(acac) 3 :mIm were 0.16, 0.32, 0.63 and 1.27). For Co(acac) 3 ):mIm = 1.27, typically 3.94 g of mIm were dissolved in 100 ml of methanol with stirring in a flask. The other 100 ml of methanol contained 3.57 g of Zn(NO 3 )∙6H 2 O and 5 g of Co(acac) 3 . The two solutions were mixed in a flask, which was kept at 60 °C for 24 h for ZIF-8 crystal growth. The obtained precipitant was separated by centrifugation and thoroughly washed with methanol.

Synthesis of Fe catalyst. The Fe(mIm)–NC(1.0) catalyst was synthesized using the same method as that for the Co catalyst, and included ligand exchange with an Fe(acac) 3 :mIm mass ratio of 1.27.

Synthesis of Co(mIm) 4 @ZIF-8 precursors. Co(acac) 3 @ZIF-8 (1.0 g) was ultrasonically redispersed in 50 ml of methanol with additional mIm (mass ratio of Co(acac) 3 @ZIF-8:mIm was 1). The dispersion was transferred into a 100 ml Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 140 °C for 4 h. After cooling to room temperature, the product was separated by centrifugation and washed serval times with methanol and finally dried at 120 °C under vacuum overnight.

Synthesis of Co catalysts. The Co(acac) 3 @ZIF-8 and Co(mIm) 4 @ZIF-8 powders were transferred to ceramic boats and placed in a tube furnace. The furnace was heated to 1,000 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1, and then held at 1,000 °C for 1 h under an Ar environment before being naturally cooled to room temperature. The obtained materials were directly used without additional treatment.

reasoning: 

Alright, the user wants me to summarize the catalyst synthesis procedures from a technical paragraph as if I'm a professional chemist specializing in catalysts. Let me start by reading through the provided text carefully.

First, the synthesis involves cobalt and iron catalysts derived from ZIF-8 precursors. The key precursors mentioned are Co(acac)₃@ZIF-8 and Co(mIm)₄@ZIF-8, followed by pyrolysis to form the active catalysts. The user specifically asks for all details, so I need to extract each step precisely.

Looking at the Co(acac)₃@ZIF-8 synthesis, they vary the Co(acac)₃ to mIm mass ratios. The example given is for ratio 1.27: dissolving mIm in methanol, and another solution with Zn nitrate and Co(acac)₃. Mixing them at 60°C for 24 hours, then centrifugation and washing. That's the first procedure. 

Next, the Fe catalyst uses the same method but with Fe(acac)₃ instead. The mass ratio is the same, 1.27. So the process is identical, just swapping the metal precursor. 

Then there's Co(mIm)₄@ZIF-8 synthesis. Here, they take the already made Co(acac)₃@ZIF-8, redisperse it with additional mIm in methanol, and perform a solvothermal reaction in an autoclave at 140°C. After that, centrifugation, washing, and vacuum drying. This seems like a post-modification step to exchange ligands. 

Finally, the pyrolysis: both precursors are heated to 1000°C under argon. The ramp rate and hold time are specified, and no post-treatment is done. The resulting materials are the catalysts. 

I should note the cobalt loadings in the precursors based on the ratios provided. Also, the Fe catalyst is named Fe(mIm)–NC(1.0), which might indicate a nitrogen-doped carbon structure post-pyrolysis. 

The user is likely a researcher or student needing a clear, concise summary for replication or understanding. They might be preparing an experiment or writing a report. Ensuring all parameters (masses, temperatures, times) are included is crucial. Highlighting the ligand exchange step and the pyrolysis conditions as critical for catalyst formation would be important. 

I should check if any steps are ambiguous. For example, the solvothermal step uses a Teflon-lined autoclave, which is standard. The drying conditions (120°C under vacuum) are also detailed. Mentioning that the catalysts are used directly after pyrolysis without treatment emphasizes their readiness. 

Organizing the summary by precursor type and then the pyrolysis step makes sense. Clarifying that Fe synthesis mirrors Co but with Fe(acac)₃ avoids repetition. Including the specific ratios and the example masses for the 1.27 ratio adds necessary detail. 

The user's deeper need is likely to grasp the synthesis workflow efficiently, possibly for application in catalysis projects or academic work. Ensuring accuracy in parameters and steps is key to avoiding replication issues. Highlighting the metal-ligand interactions and the role of pyrolysis in forming active sites might be underlying interests, though not explicitly asked.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here is a professional chemist's summary of the catalysts synthesized and their detailed synthesis procedures:

**Catalysts Synthesized:**

1.  **Co(acac)₃@ZIF-8 Precursors:** Cobalt acetylacetonate encapsulated within ZIF-8 metal-organic framework crystals. Synthesized with varying Co loadings (mass ratios Co(acac)₃ : mIm = 0.16, 0.32, 0.63, 1.27).
2.  **Fe(mIm)–NC(1.0) Catalyst:** Iron-based catalyst derived from a ZIF-8 precursor containing Fe(acac)₃. The "NC" suggests a nitrogen-doped carbon material formed after pyrolysis. Mass ratio Fe(acac)₃ : mIm = 1.27.
3.  **Co(mIm)₄@ZIF-8 Precursors:** Modified ZIF-8 precursor where cobalt is coordinated with methylimidazole (mIm) ligands, likely formed via ligand exchange from Co(acac)₃@ZIF-8. Mass ratio Co(acac)₃@ZIF-8 : mIm = 1.
4.  **Co Catalysts:** Final active catalysts obtained by pyrolyzing either the **Co(acac)₃@ZIF-8** or **Co(mIm)₄@ZIF-8** precursors. These are cobalt nanoparticles embedded within a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (Co-N-C).

2.  **Synthesis of Fe(mIm)–NC(1.0) Catalyst:**
    *   **Materials:** 2-methylimidazole (mIm), Zn(NO₃)₂·6H₂O, Fe(acac)₃, Methanol.
    *   **Procedure:**
        *   Follow the **exact same procedure** as for **Co(acac)₃@ZIF-8** (Ratio 1.27), but substitute **Fe(acac)₃** (5.00 g) for Co(acac)₃. *Mass ratio Fe(acac)₃ : mIm = 1.27.*
        *   (The precursor is Fe(acac)₃@ZIF-8; the final catalyst Fe(mIm)–NC(1.0) is obtained after pyrolysis - see step 4).

3.  **Synthesis of Co(mIm)₄@ZIF-8 Precursors:**
    *   **Materials:** Pre-synthesized Co(acac)₃@ZIF-8, additional 2-methylimidazole (mIm), Methanol.
    *   **Procedure:**
        *   Take **Co(acac)₃@ZIF-8** precursor (1.0 g).
        *   **Ultrasonically redisperse** it in 50 ml methanol.
        *   Add additional **mIm** (mass ratio Co(acac)₃@ZIF-8 : mIm = **1**, therefore 1.0 g mIm).
        *   Transfer the dispersion into a **100 ml Teflon-lined autoclave**.
        *   Heat the autoclave to **140 °C** and hold for **4 hours** (solvothermal reaction for ligand exchange).
        *   Cool the autoclave to **room temperature**.
        *   Separate the product by **centrifugation**.
        *   Wash the product **several times with methanol**.
        *   Dry the washed product at **120 °C under vacuum overnight**.

4.  **Synthesis of Co Catalysts (Pyrolysis):**
    *   **Materials:** Co(acac)₃@ZIF-8 or Co(mIm)₄@ZIF-8 precursor powder.
    *   **Procedure:**
        *   Transfer the precursor powder (**Co(acac)₃@ZIF-8** or **Co(mIm)₄@ZIF-8**) into **ceramic boats**.
        *   Place the boats in a **tube furnace**.
        *   Purge the furnace with **Argon (Ar)** gas.
        *   Heat the furnace from room temperature to **1000 °C** at a **heating rate of 5 °C min⁻¹**.
        *   Hold the temperature at **1000 °C for 1 hour** under continuous **Ar flow**.
        *   Allow the furnace to **cool naturally to room temperature**.
        *   The resulting black powder (**Co-N-C catalyst**) is used **directly without any additional treatment**.

**Key Points:**
*   The core synthesis involves encapsulating metal complexes (Co(acac)₃ or Fe(acac)₃) within the ZIF-8 framework during its crystallization.
*   Ligand exchange (mIm for acac) is performed on the Co-containing precursor via a solvothermal step to form Co(mIm)₄@ZIF-8.
*   The final active catalysts (Co-N-C, Fe-N-C) are formed by high-temperature pyrolysis (1000°C under Ar) of the metal-containing ZIF-8 precursors, carbonizing the organic framework and reducing the metal, resulting in metal nanoparticles within a conductive, nitrogen-doped carbon matrix.
*   The "NC" notation in Fe(mIm)–NC(1.0) explicitly confirms the nitrogen-doped carbon nature of the pyrolyzed material. The Co catalysts are implied to have the same structure.
