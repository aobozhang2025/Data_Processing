question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Synthesis of Pt/SiO 2 catalyst The reference Pt/SiO 2 catalyst was synthesized using the wetness impregnation method. H 2 PtCl 6 solution (800 µl) of appropriate con- centration was added to 1 g of hydrophilic SiO 2 powder. The mixture was stirred until dry and further dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight. The catalyst was reduced at 350 °C for 2 h under 10% H 2 /90% Ar before catalytic evaluation or characterizations.

Synthesis of γ-Mo 2 N γ-Mo 2 N was synthesized using a temperature-programmed nitridation technique. Ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 ·4H 2 O) powder (10 g) was calcined in a muffle furnace at 500 °C for 10 h to synthesize MoO 3 . Subsequently, 2 g of untreated MoO 3 powder was nitridated in pure ammonia flow (200 ml min −1 ) by the following temperature-programmed procedure: heated from room tempera- ture to 350 °C at a rate of 10 °C min −1 , then to 450 °C at 0.5 °C min −1 and finally to 785 °C at 2 °C min −1 . The sample was held at 785 °C for an additional 4 h. The sample was then cooled down to room temperature and subjected to passivation using 0.5% O 2 /Ar (60 ml min −1 ) as the pas- sivation gas overnight to yield the γ-Mo 2 N powder.

Synthesis of α-MoC α-MoC was synthesized through a two-step temperature-programmed nitridation–carburization approach. Initially, 1 g of MoO 3 powder was heated in pure ammonia (160 ml min −1 ) from room temperature to 700 °C at a rate of 5 °C min −1 and maintained at 700 °C for 2 h. After the nitridation process, the sample was cooled down to room temperature, then heated in 20% CH 4 /80% H 2 (160 ml min −1 ) to 700 °C at 5 °C min −1 and held at 700 °C for 2 h. The sample was then cooled down to room temperature and subsequently subjected to passivation using 0.5% O 2 /Ar as the passivation gas overnight to obtain the α-MoC powder.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis. They've provided three synthesis procedures and want me to summarize what catalysts were made and their synthesis details. 

First, I need to identify the three catalysts clearly: Pt/SiO₂ (platinum on silica), γ-Mo₂N (gamma-phase molybdenum nitride), and α-MoC (alpha-phase molybdenum carbide). The user seems to need precise technical details - probably for research replication or documentation purposes. 

For Pt/SiO₂: It's a straightforward wet impregnation. Key points are the H₂PtCl₆ solution volume (800 µl), silica support (1g hydrophilic), drying conditions (vacuum oven at 60°C overnight), and critical reduction step (350°C under 10% H₂/Ar). Must emphasize the reduction is mandatory before use.

γ-Mo₂N synthesis is more complex. Starts with ammonium molybdate calcination to MoO₃ (500°C/10h), then intricate temperature ramps under NH₃ flow. The slow ramp to 450°C (0.5°C/min) is crucial for phase control. Passivation with dilute oxygen prevents pyrophoricity - important safety note.

α-MoC uses a hybrid approach: first nitridation under NH₃ to an intermediate, then carburization with CH₄/H₂. Same passivation step. The two-step nature distinguishes it from γ-Mo₂N. Should highlight the gas composition changes between steps.

User likely needs this for lab work - maybe a grad student or industrial researcher. They'd care about replicability, so I'll include all parameters: exact temperatures, ramp rates, gas flow rates, and hold times. The passivation steps are critical for handling safety too. 

Noticing all syntheses involve passivation or reduction - that's a common thread. Also, both molybdenum catalysts use temperature-programmed reactions but with different strategies. Should contrast them clearly in the summary.

Based on the provided text, here's a professional chemist's summary of the synthesized catalysts and their detailed synthesis procedures:

**1. Catalyst Synthesized: Pt/SiO₂ (Platinum supported on Silica Dioxide)**
*   **Synthesis Method:** Wetness Impregnation.
*   **Procedure Details:**
    1.  **Impregnation:** 800 µL of an aqueous H₂PtCl₆ (Hexachloroplatinic Acid) solution of appropriate concentration is added to 1 gram of hydrophilic SiO₂ powder. The volume is chosen to match the pore volume of the support (the "wetness" point).
    2.  **Drying (Initial):** The mixture is stirred at ambient conditions until it appears dry.
    3.  **Drying (Final):** The dried mixture is placed in a vacuum oven and dried overnight (typically ~12-16 hours) at 60 °C.
    4.  **Reduction (Activation):** The dried material is reduced under flowing gas (10% H₂ / 90% Ar) at 350 °C for 2 hours. *This step is essential to convert the platinum salt (H₂PtCl₆) into active metallic Pt nanoparticles.*
*   **Key Characteristics:** Supported metal catalyst. Requires reduction for activation.

**2. Catalyst Synthesized: γ-Mo₂N (Gamma-phase Molybdenum Nitride)**
*   **Synthesis Method:** Temperature-Programmed Nitridation (using Ammonia).
*   **Procedure Details:**
    1.  **Precursor Preparation:** 10 grams of Ammonium Molybdate Tetrahydrate ((NH₄)₆Mo₇O₂₄·4H₂O) powder is calcined in air (using a muffle furnace) at 500 °C for 10 hours to produce MoO₃ (Molybdenum Trioxide).
    2.  **Nitridation Setup:** 2 grams of the resulting MoO₃ powder is placed in a reactor under a flow of pure ammonia gas (200 mL min⁻¹).
    3.  **Temperature Programmed Nitridation:**
        *   Ramp from Room Temperature (RT) to 350 °C at 10 °C min⁻¹.
        *   Ramp from 350 °C to 450 °C at 0.5 °C min⁻¹ *(This slow ramp is critical for controlled phase transformation)*.
        *   Ramp from 450 °C to 785 °C at 2 °C min⁻¹.
        *   Hold at 785 °C for 4 hours *(Completes nitridation to γ-Mo₂N)*.
    4.  **Cooling:** The sample is cooled down to room temperature under the ammonia flow.
    5.  **Passivation:** The highly reactive fresh nitride is exposed to a flow of 0.5% O₂/Ar (60 mL min⁻¹) overnight at room temperature. *This forms a thin, protective oxide layer to prevent violent oxidation (pyrophoricity) upon contact with air.*
*   **Key Characteristics:** Bulk transition metal nitride. Requires careful temperature programming and passivation.

**3. Catalyst Synthesized: α-MoC (Alpha-phase Molybdenum Carbide)**
*   **Synthesis Method:** Two-Step Temperature-Programmed Nitridation-Carburization.
*   **Procedure Details:**
    1.  **Nitridation Step:**
        *   1 gram of MoO₃ powder is placed in a reactor under pure ammonia flow (160 mL min⁻¹).
        *   Temperature is ramped from RT to 700 °C at 5 °C min⁻¹.
        *   Held at 700 °C for 2 hours. *(Forms an intermediate nitride, often Mo₂N)*.
        *   Cooled down to RT under ammonia flow.
    2.  **Carburization Step:**
        *   The gas flow is switched to 20% CH₄ / 80% H₂ (160 mL min⁻¹).
        *   Temperature is ramped from RT to 700 °C at 5 °C min⁻¹.
        *   Held at 700 °C for 2 hours. *(Converts the nitride intermediate into α-MoC)*.
        *   Cooled down to RT under the CH₄/H₂ flow.
    3.  **Passivation:** The highly reactive fresh carbide is exposed to a flow of 0.5% O₂/Ar overnight at room temperature. *This forms a thin, protective oxide layer to prevent violent oxidation (pyrophoricity) upon contact with air.*
*   **Key Characteristics:** Bulk transition metal carbide. Requires a two-step (nitridation followed by carburization) approach and passivation.

**Summary of Key Synthesis Aspects:**

*   **Pt/SiO₂:** Simple impregnation/drying, but **requires reduction** to activate the metal.
*   **γ-Mo₂N:** Single-step nitridation of MoO₃ with NH₃, featuring a **critical slow ramp rate (0.5 °C/min) between 350-450°C**. Requires passivation.
*   **α-MoC:** **Two-step process** (NH₃ nitridation first, then CH₄/H₂ carburization). Requires passivation.
*   **Passivation:** Essential safety step for both γ-Mo₂N and α-MoC to handle them safely in air after synthesis.
*   **Temperature Programming:** Critical for controlling phase formation and morphology in γ-Mo₂N and α-MoC synthesis.
*   **Gas Flows:** Precisely controlled flow rates and compositions (NH₃, CH₄/H₂, O₂/Ar, H₂/Ar) are fundamental parameters throughout all syntheses.
