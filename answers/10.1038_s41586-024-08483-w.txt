question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Synthesis of Pt/SiO 2 catalyst The reference Pt/SiO 2 catalyst was synthesized using the wetness impregnation method. H 2 PtCl 6 solution (800 µl) of appropriate con- centration was added to 1 g of hydrophilic SiO 2 powder. The mixture was stirred until dry and further dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight. The catalyst was reduced at 350 °C for 2 h under 10% H 2 /90% Ar before catalytic evaluation or characterizations.

Synthesis of γ-Mo 2 N γ-Mo 2 N was synthesized using a temperature-programmed nitridation technique. Ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 ·4H 2 O) powder (10 g) was calcined in a muffle furnace at 500 °C for 10 h to synthesize MoO 3 . Subsequently, 2 g of untreated MoO 3 powder was nitridated in pure ammonia flow (200 ml min −1 ) by the following temperature-programmed procedure: heated from room tempera- ture to 350 °C at a rate of 10 °C min −1 , then to 450 °C at 0.5 °C min −1 and finally to 785 °C at 2 °C min −1 . The sample was held at 785 °C for an additional 4 h. The sample was then cooled down to room temperature and subjected to passivation using 0.5% O 2 /Ar (60 ml min −1 ) as the pas- sivation gas overnight to yield the γ-Mo 2 N powder.

Synthesis of α-MoC α-MoC was synthesized through a two-step temperature-programmed nitridation–carburization approach. Initially, 1 g of MoO 3 powder was heated in pure ammonia (160 ml min −1 ) from room temperature to 700 °C at a rate of 5 °C min −1 and maintained at 700 °C for 2 h. After the nitridation process, the sample was cooled down to room temperature, then heated in 20% CH 4 /80% H 2 (160 ml min −1 ) to 700 °C at 5 °C min −1 and held at 700 °C for 2 h. The sample was then cooled down to room temperature and subsequently subjected to passivation using 0.5% O 2 /Ar as the passivation gas overnight to obtain the α-MoC powder.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize three different catalysts from the provided text. Let me carefully parse each synthesis procedure.

First for Pt/SiO₂ - this is a platinum-on-silica catalyst made by wet impregnation. The key details: they used H₂PtCl₆ solution (800µl) on 1g hydrophilic SiO₂, dried it first by stirring then in vacuum oven at 60°C overnight. Important to note the reduction step at 350°C under 10% H₂/Ar before use. 

Now γ-Mo₂N is more complex - starting from ammonium molybdate. They calcined it at 500°C for 10h to get MoO₃ first. Then temperature-programmed nitridation in ammonia flow with three ramp stages: 10°C/min to 350°C, slow 0.5°C/min to 450°C, then 2°C/min to 785°C with 4h hold. Crucial passivation step with 0.5% O₂/Ar overnight.

α-MoC synthesis is a two-step process - starts with same MoO₃ but first does nitridation in ammonia to 700°C (5°C/min ramp, 2h hold), then switches to carburization in 20% CH₄/H₂ at same temperature profile. Again finishes with identical passivation. 

Hmm the user seems to need precise technical details - probably for lab replication or documentation. I should emphasize critical parameters: temperatures, ramp rates, gas compositions, hold times. Also must highlight the passivation steps for the nitride and carbide catalysts to prevent pyrophoricity. 

The phrasing suggests they want this structured by catalyst type - so I'll organize it that way. Need to maintain all quantitative details but present them clearly. For Pt catalyst, the reduction atmosphere (10% H₂/Ar) is particularly important. For the molybdenum compounds, the exact temperature ramps are vital for phase control. 

Better include warnings about handling too - those passivated Mo compounds can still be reactive. The user might be a grad student new to catalyst synthesis, so accuracy is paramount.
