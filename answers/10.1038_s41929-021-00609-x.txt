question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Catalyst preparation. For the synthesis of ZIF-8, 2.879 g of Zn(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O and 3.080 g of 2-methylimidazole were each dissolved in 75 ml methanol. Subsequently, the two solutions were mixed with vigorous stirring for 5 min at room temperature. Then, the as-obtained mixed solution was transferred to a sealed container and placed into a constant-temperature oven at 35 °C for 2 h. Finally, the as-obtained ZIF-8 was centrifuged, washed with methanol and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. For the synthesis of Fe/ZIF-8@PZM, 160 mg of bis(4-aminophenyl) ether and 80 mg of phosphonitrilic chloride trimer were dissolved in 50 ml methanol. Then, 200 mg of the as-obtained ZIF-8 was dispersed in 10 ml of methanol, followed by mixing homogeneously with 1 ml of 10 mg ml–1 Fe(NO 3 ) 3 ·9H 2 O methanol solution. This was added to the above solution with stirring for 10 min. Subsequently, a mixture of 4 ml triethylamine and 25 ml methanol was slowly added into the above suspension, followed by stirring at 40 °C for 4 h. Finally, the as-obtained Fe/ ZIF-8@PZM was collected, washed and dried. ZIF-8@PZM was prepared with the same synthesis procedure as for Fe/ZIF-8@PZM except that Fe(NO 3 ) 3 ·9H 2 O was not added. Fe/ZIF-8 was prepared with the same synthesis procedure as for Fe/ZIF-8@PZM except that bis(4-aminophenyl) ether, phosphonitrilic chloride trimer and triethylamine were not added. The as-obtained powder of Fe/ZIF-8@ PZM was placed in a quartz boat and then kept at 950 °C for 3 h in a tube furnace with a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 under a flowing nitrogen atmosphere. The same treatment conditions were used for the Fe/ZIF-8 and ZIF-8@PZM powder samples. When these samples cooled to room temperature, the as-obtained FeN 3 P-SAzyme, FeN 4 -SAzyme and NP-C samples were each collected, without any treatment, for further use.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to summarize the catalyst synthesis procedures from this chemistry paragraph. They specifically asked me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis. 

First, I need to identify all the catalysts mentioned. The paragraph describes ZIF-8, Fe/ZIF-8@PZM, ZIF-8@PZM, Fe/ZIF-8, and their pyrolyzed forms: FeN₃P-SAzyme, FeN₄-SAzyme and NP-C. That's quite a complex set of materials!

Looking at the synthesis details, I notice this involves both metal-organic framework (MOF) preparation and post-modification steps. The ZIF-8 synthesis is straightforward - zinc nitrate and 2-methylimidazole in methanol at 35°C. But then things get more interesting with the Fe doping and polymer coating steps. 

The user seems to be asking for all details, so I should capture every measurement and condition: exact masses (2.879g Zn salt), volumes (75ml methanol), temperatures (35°C for 2h), even stirring times (5min). The Fe doping step is particularly precise with that 1ml of 10mg/ml Fe solution. 

Hmm... the pyrolysis step at 950°C under nitrogen is crucial - that's where the actual catalytic sites form. I should emphasize how the final catalysts derive from different precursors: FeN₃P-SAzyme comes from Fe/ZIF-8@PZM, FeN₄-SAzyme from Fe/ZIF-8, and NP-C from ZIF-8@PZM. 

The user might be preparing these catalysts themselves, so accuracy is critical. I'll organize this systematically - first listing all synthesized materials, then detailing each preparation procedure with all parameters. Since they're a chemist, I can use technical terms like "polyphosphazene coating" without explanation. 

I wonder if they're interested in the catalyst applications too? The paragraph doesn't specify, but the "SAzyme" naming suggests single-atom enzymes for biomimetic catalysis. Maybe that's beyond the current query scope though. 

Better double-check those reagent names - "phosphonitrilic chloride trimer" is hexachlorophosphazene, and "bis(4-aminophenyl) ether" is ODAPE. Should I include those chemical names? Probably yes for professional clarity. 

The centrifugation and drying steps matter for reproducibility - 80°C for 12h isn't arbitrary. And that slow 5°C/min ramp to 950°C suggests careful carbonization to preserve active sites. Every detail counts in catalyst synthesis!

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here's a professional summary of the catalysts synthesized and their detailed procedures:

**Catalysts Synthesized:**

1.  **ZIF-8:** Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-8 (Zn(mIm)₂), a MOF precursor.
2.  **Fe/ZIF-8@PZM:** ZIF-8 simultaneously doped with Iron (Fe) and coated with a Polyphosphazene (PZM) polymer layer.
3.  **ZIF-8@PZM:** ZIF-8 coated only with the Polyphosphazene (PZM) polymer layer (no Fe).
4.  **Fe/ZIF-8:** ZIF-8 doped only with Iron (Fe) (no polymer coating).
5.  **FeN₃P-SAzyme:** Pyrolyzed form of Fe/ZIF-8@PZM, expected to contain Fe-N₃P single-atom sites.
6.  **FeN₄-SAzyme:** Pyrolyzed form of Fe/ZIF-8, expected to contain Fe-N₄ single-atom sites.
7.  **NP-C:** Pyrolyzed form of ZIF-8@PZM, expected to be a N,P-doped carbon material.

**Detailed Synthesis Procedures:**

1.  **ZIF-8 Synthesis:**
    *   Dissolve 2.879 g Zn(NO₃)₂·6H₂O in 75 ml methanol.
    *   Dissolve 3.080 g 2-methylimidazole in 75 ml methanol.
    *   Mix both solutions with vigorous stirring for 5 minutes at room temperature.
    *   Transfer the mixture to a sealed container.
    *   Place container in a constant-temperature oven at 35 °C for 2 hours.
    *   Centrifuge the resulting ZIF-8 solid.
    *   Wash the solid with methanol.
    *   Dry the solid at 80 °C for 12 hours.

2.  **Fe/ZIF-8@PZM Synthesis:**
    *   Dissolve 160 mg bis(4-aminophenyl) ether (ODA) and 80 mg phosphonitrilic chloride trimer (HCCP) in 50 ml methanol. *(This forms the PZM polymer precursors)*.
    *   Disperse 200 mg of the pre-synthesized ZIF-8 in 10 ml methanol.
    *   Mix the ZIF-8 dispersion homogeneously with 1 ml of a 10 mg ml⁻¹ Fe(NO₃)₃·9H₂O methanol solution (providing 10 mg Fe). *(This simultaneously dopes ZIF-8 with Fe)*.
    *   Add this Fe-doped ZIF-8 dispersion to the ODA/HCCP/methanol solution with stirring for 10 minutes.
    *   Slowly add a mixture of 4 ml triethylamine (TEA, catalyst) and 25 ml methanol into the above suspension.
    *   Stir the combined mixture at 40 °C for 4 hours. *(Polymerization and coating occur)*.
    *   Collect the solid Fe/ZIF-8@PZM by centrifugation/filtration.
    *   Wash the solid.
    *   Dry the solid.

3.  **ZIF-8@PZM Synthesis:**
    *   Follow the *exact* procedure for Fe/ZIF-8@PZM **except** omit the addition of the Fe(NO₃)₃·9H₂O methanol solution. Only ZIF-8 is dispersed and added to the ODA/HCCP solution.

4.  **Fe/ZIF-8 Synthesis:**
    *   Follow the *exact* procedure for Fe/ZIF-8@PZM **except** omit the addition of bis(4-aminophenyl) ether (ODA), phosphonitrilic chloride trimer (HCCP), and the triethylamine/methanol mixture. Only the step of dispersing ZIF-8 and adding the Fe(NO₃)₃·9H₂O solution is performed, followed by collection, washing, and drying.

5.  **Pyrolysis to Form Final Catalysts (FeN₃P-SAzyme, FeN₄-SAzyme, NP-C):**
    *   Place the as-obtained powder of Fe/ZIF-8@PZM in a quartz boat.
    *   Place the quartz boat in a tube furnace.
    *   Heat the sample to 950 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min⁻¹.
    *   Hold the sample at 950 °C for 3 hours.
    *   Maintain a flowing nitrogen (N₂) atmosphere throughout the heating and hold time.
    *   Allow the sample to cool to room temperature under N₂.
    *   Collect the resulting black powder (FeN₃P-SAzyme) without further treatment.
    *   **Repeat this identical pyrolysis procedure** for:
        *   Fe/ZIF-8 powder -> yields **FeN₄-SAzyme**
        *   ZIF-8@PZM powder -> yields **NP-C**

**Key Synthesis Notes:**

*   **Polymerization:** The coating step (Fe/ZIF-8@PZM & ZIF-8@PZM) involves the polycondensation of ODA and HCCP catalyzed by TEA to form the poly(cyclotriphosphazene-co-4,4'-oxydianiline) (PZM) network *around* the ZIF-8 particles.
*   **Fe Doping:** Iron is introduced *simultaneously* with polymer coating in Fe/ZIF-8@PZM by pre-mixing the ZIF-8 dispersion with the Fe solution before adding to the polymer precursors.
*   **Pyrolysis:** The high-temperature treatment under inert gas (N₂) carbonizes the organic components (ZIF-8 imidazolate ligands and PZM polymer), volatilizes zinc, and transforms the Fe into atomically dispersed metal sites coordinated by N (and P in the case of FeN₃P-SAzyme) within a nitrogen-doped (and phosphorus-doped for NP-C and FeN₃P-SAzyme) carbon matrix. The specific coordination (Fe-N₄ vs Fe-N₃P) is dictated by the precursor's composition (presence/absence of PZM polymer coating).
