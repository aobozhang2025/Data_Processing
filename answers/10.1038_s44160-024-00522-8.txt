question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

To prepare Pd/TiO2, we began by cutting titanium plates (TP) into small pieces (2.5 × 4.5 cm) and sonicating them in acetone, ethanol and distilled water for 30 min each. These pieces were then placed in a 50 ml Teflon-lined autoclave containing 40 ml of 5 M NaOH aqueous solution  100 80 60 40 20 0  0  20  40  60  80  100  FENO3  – (%)  j (mA cm–2)  Photocatalysis  Commercial  electricity  Production profit (USD per  kilogram of HNO3)  0.15  0.55  0.4  0  0  0.4  Renewable  electricity  0  1,000  2,000  3,000  4,000  5,000  Generated NO3  − (μmol)  1 cm−2 cell  0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200  0  5  10  15  20  25  30  35  Time (h)  Cell FE (NO3  −) (%)  1  2  Voltage (V)  Current density: 15 mA cm−2  Flowrate: 18 ml h−1  NO3  − productivity: 5.84 nmol s−1  Air  O2 + H2O H2O2  NO3  −  Air Renewable energy NO3  Electrolyte  Pd/TiO2  Carbon nanofibres N2 + H2O2  Cathode  Anode  Direct electrochemical process  CH4 H2O  O2 N2 (from air)  Steam reforming  P: 14−40 atm.

After cooling to room temperature, the samples were washed multiple times with de-ionized (DI) water and ethanol, dried at 60 °C for 2 h. The samples were then immersed in 0.25 M Pd(NO3)2 solution for 1 h to exchange Na+ ions with Pd2+. The resulting PdTi2O5·H2O/TP was rinsed with DI water and ethanol multiple times and dried at 60 °C for 2 h. The samples were then annealed in a tube furnace at 500 °C under an Ar atmosphere for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, the final product, Pd/TiO2/TP, was obtained. The only difference for the preparation of Ru, Rh, Ir, Pt and TiO2/TP is to soak the sample in 1 m HCl for 1 h to exchange Na+ with Ru3+, Rh3+, Ir3+, Pt2+ and H+. At last, two titanium sheets (2 × 4 cm) loaded with Pd/TiO2 were placed in 10 ml of ethanol and peeled off with an ultrasonic cell disruptor for 1 h. Subsequently, the obtained dispersion was centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 10 min, and the precipitate containing Pd/TiO2 nanosheets was thoroughly washed with DI water and ethanol. We obtained CrO2, Mn3O4, Fe3O4 and Co3O4 from Aladdin Ltd.

reasoning: 

Alright, the user wants me to summarize the catalyst synthesis from a technical paragraph. Let me start by identifying the key catalyst mentioned. The main one is Pd/TiO2, supported on titanium plates. The procedure involves several steps: substrate preparation, hydrothermal treatment, ion exchange, annealing, and finally harvesting the catalyst powder.

First, the titanium plates are cut and cleaned through sonication in different solvents. Then, they undergo hydrothermal treatment in NaOH at high temperature, forming sodium titanate. After washing, the ion exchange step replaces Na+ with Pd2+ using Pd(NO3)2. The annealing converts it to Pd/TiO2. For other metals like Ru or Pt, they use HCl instead. The powder is harvested via ultrasonication and centrifugation.

I should check if all steps are clearly covered. The user is likely a chemist or researcher needing precise synthesis details. They might be replicating this or comparing methods. The mention of other catalysts (Ru, Rh, etc.) suggests interest in variations. Also, the economic data in the paragraph might be relevant, but the query focuses on synthesis. I'll highlight the Pd/TiO2 process first, then note the differences for other metals. Ensuring clarity on solvents, temperatures, times, and post-processing steps is crucial. The centrifugation details are important for obtaining the final powder. Need to confirm all parameters are accurately extracted without including unrelated economic analysis.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, the synthesized catalyst is **Pd/TiO<sub>2</sub> supported on Titanium Plates (Pd/TiO<sub>2</sub>/TP)**. A powder form of **Pd/TiO<sub>2</sub> nanosheets** is also obtained by peeling the catalyst off the plates.

Here is a detailed summary of the synthesis procedure:

1.  **Substrate Preparation:**
    *   Titanium plates (TP) are cut into pieces (2.5 × 4.5 cm).
    *   The pieces are sonicated sequentially in acetone, ethanol, and distilled water for 30 minutes each to clean the surface.

2.  **Hydrothermal Synthesis of Sodium Titanate:**
    *   The cleaned TP pieces are placed in a 50 ml Teflon-lined autoclave.
    *   The autoclave is filled with 40 ml of a 5 M aqueous NaOH solution.
    *   The autoclave is sealed and heated to **180 °C** for **24 hours**.
    *   After this reaction, the samples are allowed to cool down to room temperature.

3.  **Washing & Drying (Post-Hydrothermal):**
    *   The samples (now likely sodium titanate nanostructures on TP) are washed multiple times with de-ionized (DI) water and ethanol.
    *   The washed samples are dried at **60 °C** for **2 hours**.

4.  **Palladium Loading (Ion Exchange):**
    *   The dried samples are immersed in a **0.25 M Pd(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>** aqueous solution for **1 hour**. This step exchanges Na<sup>+</sup> ions in the sodium titanate with Pd<sup>2+</sup> ions.
    *   The resulting material is labeled as **PdTi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O/TP**.

5.  **Post-Exchange Washing & Drying:**
    *   The PdTi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O/TP samples are rinsed multiple times with DI water and ethanol.
    *   The rinsed samples are dried again at **60 °C** for **2 hours**.

6.  **Annealing (Formation of Pd/TiO<sub>2</sub>/TP):**
    *   The dried samples are placed in a tube furnace.
    *   The furnace is purged with an **Argon (Ar)** atmosphere.
    *   The samples are annealed at **500 °C** for **2 hours** under flowing Ar. This step converts the hydrated titanate structure into crystalline TiO<sub>2</sub> and stabilizes the Pd species.
    *   After annealing, the furnace is cooled to room temperature under Ar.
    *   The final supported catalyst product is **Pd/TiO<sub>2</sub>/TP**.

7.  **Preparation of Other Metal Catalysts (Ru, Rh, Ir, Pt) and TiO<sub>2</sub>/TP:**
    *   *Note: This step is distinct from the Pd/TiO<sub>2</sub> synthesis but follows the same initial hydrothermal step.*
    *   After the hydrothermal step, washing, and drying (steps 1-3), samples intended for Ru, Rh, Ir, Pt, or pure TiO<sub>2</sub> are immersed in **1 M HCl** solution for **1 hour**.
    *   This exchanges Na<sup>+</sup> ions with Ru<sup>3+</sup>, Rh<sup>3+</sup>, Ir<sup>3+</sup>, Pt<sup>2+</sup>, or H<sup>+</sup> (for TiO<sub>2</sub>), respectively.
    *   Subsequent washing, drying, and annealing steps (steps 5 & 6) are performed similarly to form Ru/TiO<sub>2</sub>/TP, Rh/TiO<sub>2</sub>/TP, etc., or TiO<sub>2</sub>/TP.

8.  **Harvesting Pd/TiO<sub>2</sub> Nanosheet Powder (Optional):**
    *   To obtain powder catalyst material, two Pd/TiO<sub>2</sub>/TP sheets (2 × 4 cm) are placed in **10 ml of ethanol**.
    *   The sheets are subjected to ultrasonication using an **ultrasonic cell disruptor for 1 hour** to peel the Pd/TiO<sub>2</sub> nanosheets off the titanium plate.
    *   The resulting dispersion is centrifuged at **8,000 rpm for 10 minutes**.
    *   The precipitate (containing the Pd/TiO<sub>2</sub> nanosheets) is collected and thoroughly washed with DI water and ethanol.
    *   This yields the final **Pd/TiO<sub>2</sub> nanosheet powder**.

**Key Catalyst:** Pd/TiO<sub>2</sub> (as supported plates Pd/TiO<sub>2</sub>/TP or as powder nanosheets).
**Support:** Titanium Plate (TP) for the initial synthesis, converted to TiO<sub>2</sub> nanostructures.
**Active Metal:** Palladium (Pd), loaded via ion exchange from Pd(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.
**Critical Steps:** Hydrothermal treatment in NaOH, Pd<sup>2+</sup> ion exchange, Annealing at 500°C under Ar.
**Additional Note:** Other catalysts (M/TiO<sub>2</sub>/TP where M = Ru, Rh, Ir, Pt, or H for TiO<sub>2</sub>) were synthesized using HCl for ion exchange instead of Pd(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. Commercially available oxides (CrO<sub>2</sub>, Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) were purchased.
