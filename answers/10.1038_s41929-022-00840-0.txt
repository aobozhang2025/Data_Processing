question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Synthesis of CAZ-1. CAZ-1 was synthesized by a co-precipitation method using Na 2 CO 3 as precipitant. First, Cu(NO 3 ) 2 ·3H 2 O (Sigma-Aldrich, 98–103%) and Zr(NO 3 ) 4 ·5H 2 O (Macklin, AR) precursors were weighed according to the metal loading and dissolved together into 100 ml deionized water to make a 0.03 M solution (solution A). An appropriate amount of Na 2 CO 3 was weighed and dissolved in 100 ml deionized water to make a 0.06 M solution (solution B). After dissolution was complete, a peristaltic pump was used to slowly drip the two solutions A and B into another beaker containing 100 ml of deionized water at a rate of 0.3 ml min−1. Throughout the dropping process, the mixture was stirred at 350 rpm while heating at 80 °C. Once the dropping was complete, stirring was stopped and the flocculent precipitate that had formed was aged at 80 °C for 2 h. After ageing, it was cooled to room temperature and washed with deionized water to pH 7, followed by drying in an oven at 80 °C overnight. Finally, the blue solid sample was ground into powder and calcined in a muffle furnace by heating at 2 °C min−1 to 350 °C over 5 h.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalyst synthesis procedure from a given paragraph. Let me carefully analyze this technical description.

First, I need to identify the key elements: the catalyst being synthesized is CAZ-1, which appears to be a copper-zirconium based material. The method used is co-precipitation with sodium carbonate as the precipitating agent. 

Breaking down the synthesis steps: They start by preparing two solutions - Solution A containing dissolved copper and zirconium nitrates, and Solution B with sodium carbonate. The concentrations are precise: 0.03M for the metal solution and 0.06M for carbonate. 

The mixing process is critical - they use a peristaltic pump for controlled addition into heated water while maintaining vigorous stirring. The aging step at 80°C for 2 hours suggests this is important for crystallite formation or phase transformation. 

Post-precipitation steps are equally important: thorough washing to neutral pH, careful drying at 80°C, and finally calcination with a controlled ramp rate to 350°C. The blue color indicates copper(II) presence before calcination.

I should highlight several technical nuances: the stoichiometric ratio implied by the concentrations, the importance of controlled addition rate and temperature, and how the calcination conditions likely affect the final catalyst structure. The user seems to need this for replication or documentation purposes, so precision in reporting parameters is crucial.

The mention of specific suppliers and purity grades suggests this may be for a methods section in publication. I'll maintain all technical details while organizing them chronologically for clarity. The final calcination step is particularly important as it likely converts the precursor to the active oxide catalyst.

answer: 

Based on the provided procedure, here's a professional summary of the catalyst synthesized and its synthesis:

1.  **Catalyst Synthesized:**
    *   **Name:** CAZ-1
    *   **Composition:** Copper-Zirconium oxide-based catalyst (inferred from precursors and final calcination step).
    *   **Precursor Form:** Blue solid (before calcination), indicating hydrated copper(II) compounds.
    *   **Final Form:** Powder (after grinding calcined material).

2.  **Synthesis Procedure (Co-precipitation Method):**

    **a. Precursor Solution Preparation (Solution A):**
    *   Dissolve weighed amounts of `Cu(NO₃)₂·3H₂O` (Sigma-Aldrich, 98-103%) and `Zr(NO₃)₄·5H₂O` (Macklin, AR grade) in 100 ml deionized water.
    *   The amounts are calculated based on the desired **metal loading** to achieve a **total metal ion concentration of 0.03 M**.
    *   Designated as **Solution A**.

    **b. Precipitant Solution Preparation (Solution B):**
    *   Dissolve an appropriate amount of `Na₂CO₃` in 100 ml deionized water.
    *   The amount is calculated to achieve a **concentration of 0.06 M**.
    *   Designated as **Solution B**.

    **c. Co-precipitation:**
    *   Place 100 ml of deionized water into a separate beaker.
    *   Heat this water to **80 °C** and maintain stirring at **350 rpm**.
    *   Using a **peristaltic pump**, simultaneously and slowly drip **both Solution A and Solution B** into the beaker containing the heated/stirred water.
    *   Maintain a **constant addition rate of 0.3 ml min⁻¹** for each solution (total addition rate 0.6 ml min⁻¹).
    *   Maintain **80 °C temperature and 350 rpm stirring** throughout the addition process.

    **d. Ageing:**
    *   Once the addition of Solutions A and B is complete, **stop stirring**.
    *   Allow the resulting **flocculent precipitate** to **age (remain undisturbed) at 80 °C for 2 hours**.

    **e. Washing:**
    *   Cool the aged precipitate mixture to **room temperature**.
    *   **Wash** the precipitate repeatedly with deionized water until the supernatant reaches **pH 7** (neutral). This removes soluble sodium nitrate salts and excess carbonate.

    **f. Drying:**
    *   Transfer the washed precipitate to an oven.
    *   **Dry** at **80 °C overnight** (~12-16 hours) to remove residual water.

    **g. Calcination:**
    *   Grind the dried **blue solid** into a finer powder.
    *   Place the powder in a **muffle furnace**.
    *   Apply a **ramped heating program**: Heat from room temperature to **350 °C** at a **controlled rate of 2 °C min⁻¹**.
    *   **Hold** at 350 °C for **5 hours**. (Note: The text states "heating at 2 °C min⁻¹ *to* 350 °C *over* 5 h", implying the ramp *plus* hold totals 5 hours. A 2°C/min ramp to 350°C takes ~2.9 hours, leaving ~2.1 hours hold time).
    *   This step decomposes the nitrate/carbonate precursors into the final mixed metal oxide catalyst (likely CuO/ZrO₂).

**Key Synthesis Details:**

*   **Method:** Co-precipitation using Na₂CO₃ as precipitant.
*   **Precursors:** `Cu(NO₃)₂·3H₂O`, `Zr(NO₃)₄·5H₂O`, `Na₂CO₃`.
*   **Solution Concentrations:** Solution A = 0.03 M (total metals), Solution B = 0.06 M.
*   **Addition:** Simultaneous, slow drip (0.3 ml/min each) into heated (80°C), stirred (350 rpm) water.
*   **Ageing:** 80°C, 2 h, unstirred.
*   **Washing:** To pH 7 with deionized water.
*   **Drying:** 80°C, overnight.
*   **Calcination:** 2°C/min ramp to 350°C, hold for total time of 5 hours (ramp + hold).
