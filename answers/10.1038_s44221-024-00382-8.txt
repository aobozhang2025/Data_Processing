question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Preparation of Co 1 CNCl/S and other Co-based SACs NaCl (3 g), glucose (300 mg), CoSO 4 ·7H 2 O (28.1 mg) and dicyandi- amide (332 mg) were dissolved in 30 ml of deionized water and stirred continuously for 2 h. The resulting solution was freeze dried under vacuum to yield a powder, which was then ground in a mortar and pyrolysed at 900 °C for 2 h under an argon atmosphere, with a heating rate of 5 °C min −1 . After cooling to room temperature, the black powder was subjected to acid etching with 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 to remove unstable Co species and NaCl. The obtained black powder was dried at 60 °C, and the sample was designated as Co 1 CNCl/S. Carbon samples were also synthesized similarly without CoSO 4 ·7H 2 O. Other Co SACs were prepared using different precursors of Co salts. CN/S was obtained using the same mole amount of Na 2 SO 4 without Co salts. C/S was syn- thesized without Co salts and dicyandiamide but with Na 2 SO 4 . Co 1 CN and Co 1 CN/S were prepared by pyrolysis of a mixture of CoPc and CN or CN/S (Co content is approximately 2 wt.%), respectively, at 450 °C under flowing argon for 1 h.

Results Synthesis and morphology of Co-SACs The synthesis procedure of Co 1 CNCl/S is shown in Fig. 1a. First, CoSO 4 , dicyandiamide, glucose and sodium chloride (NaCl) were dissolved in water and then freeze dried to encapsulate Co ions and other mol- ecules within NaCl crystal lattice. Afterwards, the resulting mixture was annealed at 900 °C in an argon atmosphere, leading to the carboniza- tion of glucose to form a graphene network between the salt lattice to obtain a three-dimensional (3D) Co-SAC nanosheets–NaCl mixture.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalyst synthesis details from the provided paragraph. Let me analyze this carefully.

First, I need to identify the main catalyst being discussed - it's Co₁CNCl/S, which appears to be a cobalt single-atom catalyst. The synthesis involves several key steps: dissolving precursors (NaCl, glucose, CoSO₄·7H₂O, and dicyandiamide) in water, freeze-drying to form a powder, grinding, and then high-temperature pyrolysis at 900°C under argon. 

The role of each component is interesting - NaCl likely acts as a template for 3D structure formation, glucose carbonizes to form the graphene network, dicyandiamide provides carbon and nitrogen, and CoSO₄ supplies cobalt. After pyrolysis, acid etching with 0.5M H₂SO₄ removes unstable species and NaCl template, leaving the active catalyst structure.

I should also note the control samples mentioned: carbon-only samples without cobalt, CN/S with Na₂SO₄ instead of cobalt salts, C/S without cobalt or dicyandiamide, and alternative cobalt SACs using CoPc precursor at lower temperature. These are important for comparative studies.

The mechanism described is fascinating - freeze-drying encapsulates components within NaCl crystals, and pyrolysis creates a 3D graphene network within the salt lattice. This templating approach explains the nanosheet morphology. 

I'll organize this information systematically, focusing on the step-by-step synthesis while highlighting the chemical rationale behind each component and process. The summary should maintain technical accuracy while being clear enough for a chemistry professional to understand and potentially replicate.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here's a professional chemist's summary of the synthesized catalyst and its detailed synthesis procedure:

**Synthesized Catalyst:** **Co₁CNCl/S**
*   **Type:** Cobalt-based Single-Atom Catalyst (Co-SAC).
*   **Structure:** Cobalt single atoms anchored on a nitrogen-doped carbon support.
*   **Morphology:** Three-dimensional (3D) nanosheets, facilitated by a NaCl template.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   `Co`: Cobalt single atoms (active sites).
    *   `C`: Carbon matrix (derived from glucose & dicyandiamide).
    *   `N`: Nitrogen dopant (derived from dicyandiamide).
    *   `Cl`: Chlorine residue (likely from NaCl template).
    *   `S`: Sulfur residue (likely from CoSO₄ precursor).
*   **Designation Meaning:** The name "Co₁CNCl/S" likely indicates Cobalt single atoms on a Carbon support co-doped with Nitrogen (N), Chlorine (Cl), and Sulfur (S).

**Detailed Synthesis Procedure for Co₁CNCl/S:**

1.  **Solution Preparation:**
    *   Dissolve the following in 30 ml deionized water:
        *   Sodium Chloride (NaCl): 3 g (Template/Space creator)
        *   Glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆): 300 mg (Carbon source)
        *   Cobalt(II) Sulfate Heptahydrate (CoSO₄·7H₂O): 28.1 mg (Cobalt source)
        *   Dicyandiamide (C₂H₄N₄): 332 mg (Nitrogen & Carbon source)
    *   Stir the mixture continuously for 2 hours to ensure homogeneity.

2.  **Freeze Drying:**
    *   Subject the resulting solution to freeze-drying under vacuum.
    *   **Purpose:** Sublimate the water, encapsulating the Co ions, glucose, and dicyandiamide molecules within the forming NaCl crystal lattice. This yields a dry powder.

3.  **Grinding:**
    *   Grind the freeze-dried powder thoroughly in a mortar to ensure uniformity.

4.  **Pyrolysis (Carbonization & Activation):**
    *   Place the ground powder in a furnace.
    *   Heat under a continuous argon (Ar) atmosphere to 900 °C.
    *   Maintain the target temperature (900 °C) for 2 hours.
    *   Use a controlled heating rate of 5 °C per minute during ramp-up.
    *   **Purpose:** Carbonize glucose and dicyandiamide to form a nitrogen-doped graphene-like carbon network within the NaCl lattice. Simultaneously, reduce and anchor cobalt atoms within this carbon matrix, forming the SAC structure. The NaCl acts as a template, confining the reaction and leading to the 3D nanosheet morphology.

5.  **Cooling:**
    *   Allow the furnace to cool down naturally to room temperature under argon. This yields a black powder mixture (Co-SAC nanosheets embedded within NaCl).

6.  **Acid Etching (Template & Impurity Removal):**
    *   Treat the cooled black powder with 0.5 M Sulfuric Acid (H₂SO₄).
    *   **Purpose:** Dissolve and remove the NaCl template and any unstable/leachable cobalt species (like nanoparticles or clusters) that are not strongly anchored as single atoms. This isolates the stable Co-SAC material.

7.  **Drying:**
    *   Wash the acid-etched black powder thoroughly (typically with water until neutral pH).
    *   Dry the purified catalyst powder at 60 °C.
    *   The final dried black powder is designated **Co₁CNCl/S**.

**Key Synthesis Rationale:**
*   **NaCl Template:** Encapsulates precursors during freeze-drying and confines carbon growth during pyrolysis, creating the 3D nanosheet structure. Its removal via acid etching leaves behind the porous carbon network.
*   **Glucose:** Primary carbon source, forming the graphitic backbone upon pyrolysis.
*   **Dicyandiamide:** Provides nitrogen for doping the carbon matrix and additional carbon. Nitrogen sites are crucial for anchoring the cobalt single atoms.
*   **CoSO₄·7H₂O:** Source of cobalt. The high-temperature pyrolysis in an inert atmosphere and subsequent acid leaching favor the formation and isolation of atomically dispersed Co sites coordinated to N in the carbon lattice.
*   **High-Temperature Pyrolysis (900°C):** Essential for graphitizing the carbon support and forming stable Co-Nₓ sites resistant to acid leaching.
*   **Acid Etching:** Critical step to remove the template and any non-single-atom cobalt species, confirming the SAC nature.

**Control/Reference Catalysts Mentioned:**
1.  **Carbon Samples:** Synthesized identically *without* CoSO₄·7H₂O.
2.  **CN/S:** Synthesized using the same molar amount of Na₂SO₄ *instead of* Co salts. (N-doped carbon with S residue).
3.  **C/S:** Synthesized *without* Co salts *and without* dicyandiamide, but *with* Na₂SO₄. (S-doped carbon, no N, no Co).
4.  **Co₁CN & Co₁CN/S:** Synthesized by pyrolyzing Cobalt Phthalocyanine (CoPc) mixed with pre-formed CN or CN/S support (Co ~2 wt%) at 450 °C under Ar for 1 hour. (Different SAC synthesis route).
