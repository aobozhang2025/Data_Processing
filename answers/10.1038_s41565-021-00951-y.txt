question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Synthesis of g-C 3 N 4 support. Urea was placed in a crucible and heated to 600 °C for 4 h in static air at a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1. The resulting yellow material was milled into fine powders in a mortar. Next, the yellow powder was placed in an open ceramic container and heated at 550 °C for another 4 h. A light-yellow powder of g-C 3 N 4 support was finally obtained.

Synthesis of Cu 1 /g-C 3 N 4 catalysts. Cu ALD was carried out on a viscous-flow stainless steel tube reactor system (ACME (Beijing) Technology) at 300 °C using Cu(hfac) 2 and formaldehyde as the precursors. Ultrahigh-purity N 2 (99.999%) was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 60 ml min−1. The Cu(hfac) 2 precursor container was heated to 65 °C to reach a sufficient vapour pressure. The inlet manifold was held at 100 °C to avoid precursor condensation. The timing sequence was 300, 300, 40 and 180 s for Cu(hfac) 2 exposure, N 2 purge, formaldehyde exposure and N 2 purge, respectively. One, two, and ten cycles of Cu ALD were performed on g-C 3 N 4 to obtain Cu 1 (5.1%)/g-C 3 N 4 , Cu 1 (8.1%)/g-C 3 N 4 and Cu 1 (11.4%)/g-C 3 N 4 catalysts, respectively. When the Cu(hfac) 2 exposure time was reduced to 25 and 150 s for one cycle of Cu ALD on g-C 3 N 4 , Cu loadings of 0.5% and 2.7% were obtained, which were denoted as Cu 1 (0.5%)/g-C 3 N 4 and Cu 1 (2.7%)/g-C 3 N 4 , respectively.

Synthesis of Ni 1 /g-C 3 N 4 and Ni 1 Cu 2 /g-C 3 N 4 catalysts. NiO x ALD was carried out on the g-C 3 N 4 support at 240 °C using NiCp 2 and ozone as the precursors. The NiCp 2 precursor container was heated to 90 °C to achieve a sufficient vapour pressure. The inlet manifold was held at 115 °C to avoid precursor condensation on the inner walls. The timing sequence was 1,260, 200, 1,260 and 200 s for NiCp 2 exposure, N 2 purge, O 3 exposure and N 2 purge, respectively. Different NiCp 2 exposure times (from 100 to 1,260 s) were used on g-C 3 N 4 to obtain a series of Ni single-atom catalysts with different Ni loadings (denoted as Ni 1 (x%)/g-C 3 N 4 , where x is the Ni loading). NiO x ALD was also carried on the Cu 1 (8.1%)/g-C 3 N 4 samples with different NiCp 2 exposure times (from 200 to 1,260 s). The resulting samples were denoted as Ni 1 (x%)Cu 1 (8.1%)/g-C 3 N 4 (the optimized sample, namely, Ni 1 (3.1%)Cu 1 (8.1%)/g-C 3 N 4 , was denoted as Ni 1 Cu 2 /g-C 3 N 4 ).

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalysts and procedures from a provided paragraph. Let me carefully analyze this technical text.

First, I need to identify all catalysts mentioned. There are three main categories: g-C₃N₄ support material, copper-based catalysts (Cu₁/g-C₃N₄), and nickel-based catalysts (Ni₁/g-C₃N₄ and bimetallic Ni₁Cu₂/g-C₃N₄). The percentages in parentheses indicate metal loadings.

For the g-C₃N₄ support synthesis: It's prepared by thermal decomposition of urea - heated to 600°C for 4 hours at 5°C/min ramp rate in static air, then milled and reheated at 550°C for another 4 hours. This two-step calcination is crucial for obtaining the desired graphitic carbon nitride structure.

The Cu ALD process is quite detailed: They use Cu(hfac)₂ and formaldehyde precursors at 300°C in a flow reactor. Key parameters include nitrogen carrier gas flow (60 ml/min), precursor temperatures (65°C for Cu(hfac)₂, 100°C manifold), and precise timing sequences for exposure/purge cycles. By varying cycles and exposure times, they achieve different copper loadings from 0.5% to 11.4%.

For nickel catalysts: They use NiCp₂ and ozone at 240°C. The precursor is heated to 90°C with manifold at 115°C. The cycle timing is much longer than copper - notably 1260s for each precursor exposure. They create both single-metal Ni catalysts and bimetallic versions by depositing nickel onto the copper-loaded samples.

The bimetallic catalyst notation is interesting - Ni₁Cu₂ refers to the optimized ratio (3.1% Ni + 8.1% Cu) despite the atomic ratio being different from what the subscript suggests.

I should emphasize the ALD precision - how cycle numbers and exposure times directly control metal loading. The user is clearly interested in reproducible synthesis details, so I'll highlight all critical parameters: temperatures, timings, gas flows, and precursor handling conditions. 

The summary should maintain technical accuracy while being accessible, as the user might be using this for research replication or educational purposes. I'll organize it by catalyst type and present procedures stepwise with all specifications intact.
