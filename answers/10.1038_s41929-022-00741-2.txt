question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Catalyst synthesis. CeO 2 nanorods were synthesized by a hydrothermal method as reported previously24–26. In a typical synthesis, 1.736 g of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 ·6H 2 O (Aldrich, 99.99%) was dissolved in 10 ml of deionized water then added dropwise to a concentrated NaOH solution, forming a mixed solution of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 . The concentrated NaOH solution was prepared by dissolving 19.2 g of NaOH (Aldrich, >98%) in 70 ml of deionized water. Then, the mixed solution of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 was maintained under vigorous stirring for 30 min before being transferred to a Teflon-lined, stainless steel autoclave for hydrothermal treatment at 100 °C for 24 h. Following hydrothermal synthesis, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature. The yellow powder thus obtained was washed with deionized water until its pH became neutral. Finally, the powder was dried at 60 °C in air for 10 h. This sample of CeO 2 nanorod was used as a support in the following preparation of the Rh 1 /CeO 2 catalyst. The Rh 1 /CeO 2 catalyst was prepared by the deposition–precipitation method27. In a typical synthesis, 1.0 g of CeO 2 nanorods was dispersed in 50 ml of deionized water. The mixture was sonicated for 10 min and stirred at 400 r.p.m. for 1 h; at this stage it is termed CeO 2 aqueous dispersion. Then, 5.6 mg of Rh (III) nitrate hydrate (Aldrich, ~36% Rh basis), which provided ~2.0 mg of Rh metal, was weighed and dissolved in 20 ml of deionized water. The prepared Rh salt solution was slowly introduced into the prepared CeO2 aqueous dispersion by syringe pump at a flow rate of 0.2 ml min–1 while the aqueous solution was being stirred, creating an aqueous mixture containing both Rh3+ and CeO2 nanorods. This aqueous mixture of Rh3+ and ceria nanorods was continuously stirred for an additional 3 h. The pH of the mixture was carefully adjusted to 9.5 by gradual introduction of ammonium hydroxide solution (Aldrich, 28%) while the aqueous mixture was being stirred, followed by continuous stirring for an additional 5 h. The aqueous mixture was then centrifuged at 3,000 r.p.m. for 5 min, after which the upper layer was decanted. The solid product thus obtained was dried at 60 °C in an oven overnight and calcined in a muffle furnace at 250 °C for 2 h to obtain the as-synthesized Rh1/CeO2 catalyst. The actual loading of Rh on CeO2 nanorods of the as-synthesized catalyst was measured by inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry, and was found to be 0.17 wt%. Thus, either 0.17 wt% Rh/CeO2 or Rh1/CeO2 is used interchangeably to denote the as-synthesized catalyst in the following sections.

reasoning: 

Alright, the user wants me to act as a chemist specialized in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalyst and its synthesis procedures from the given paragraph. Let me start by reading through the provided text carefully.

First, I notice there are two main catalysts mentioned: CeO₂ nanorods and Rh₁/CeO₂. The CeO₂ nanorods are synthesized via hydrothermal method, which is common for nanorod structures. The details include specific amounts of cerium nitrate hexahydrate and NaOH, dissolution steps, stirring times, and hydrothermal conditions. The post-synthesis steps like washing to neutral pH and drying are also crucial for obtaining the support material.

Then, the Rh₁/CeO₂ catalyst is prepared using deposition-precipitation. Key points here are dispersing the CeO₂ nanorods, sonication, adding rhodium nitrate solution via syringe pump, pH adjustment to 9.5 with ammonium hydroxide, and the subsequent steps like centrifugation, drying, and calcination. The actual Rh loading is 0.17 wt%, which explains the Rh₁ notation as single atoms.

I should ensure all quantitative details are included: masses, volumes, concentrations, temperatures, times, and equipment like Teflon-lined autoclave, syringe pump, muffle furnace. Also, the suppliers and purities (e.g., Aldrich 99.99%) are important for reproducibility. The pH adjustment to 9.5 is critical for deposition-precipitation, so that needs emphasis.

The user might be a researcher looking to replicate this synthesis or understand the process for their work. They might need precise details without ambiguity. Including the Rh loading confirmation via ICP-OES adds credibility. They might also be interested in why certain steps are done, like sonication for dispersion or calcination for catalyst activation. However, the query specifically asks for procedures and details, so sticking to the given steps without extrapolation is key. Making sure each synthesis phase is clearly separated and all parameters are explicitly stated will meet their needs.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here is a professional chemist's summary of the synthesized catalyst and its detailed synthesis procedures:

**Synthesized Catalyst:**
*   **Rh₁/CeO₂** (also denoted as **0.17 wt% Rh/CeO₂**)
*   **Composition:** Single Rhodium atoms (Rh₁) dispersed on Cerium Oxide (CeO₂) nanorod support.
*   **Rh Loading:** 0.17 wt% (confirmed by ICP-OES).
*   **Support Material:** Hydrothermally synthesized CeO₂ nanorods.

**Detailed Synthesis Procedures:**

**1. Synthesis of CeO₂ Nanorod Support (Hydrothermal Method):**
    *   **Precursor Solution:** Dissolve 1.736 g of Ce(NO₃)₃·6H₂O (Aldrich, 99.99%) in 10 ml deionized water.
    *   **NaOH Solution:** Dissolve 19.2 g of NaOH (Aldrich, >98%) in 70 ml deionized water to form a concentrated solution.
    *   **Mixing:** Add the Ce(NO₃)₃ solution dropwise to the concentrated NaOH solution under vigorous stirring.
    *   **Aging:** Maintain the resulting mixture under vigorous stirring for 30 minutes.
    *   **Hydrothermal Treatment:** Transfer the mixture to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. Heat at **100 °C for 24 hours**.
    *   **Cooling:** Allow the autoclave to cool naturally to room temperature.
    *   **Washing:** Collect the resulting yellow powder and wash repeatedly with deionized water until the washings reach **neutral pH**.
    *   **Drying:** Dry the washed powder at **60 °C in air for 10 hours**.

**2. Synthesis of Rh₁/CeO₂ Catalyst (Deposition-Precipitation Method):**
    *   **Dispersion:** Disperse **1.0 g** of the synthesized CeO₂ nanorods in **50 ml** deionized water.
    *   **Pre-treatment:** Sonicate the dispersion for **10 minutes**, then stir at **400 rpm for 1 hour** (forming the "CeO₂ aqueous dispersion").
    *   **Rh Precursor Solution:** Weigh **5.6 mg** of Rh(III) nitrate hydrate (Aldrich, ~36% Rh basis, providing ~2.0 mg Rh metal) and dissolve it in **20 ml** deionized water.
    *   **Metal Deposition:** Introduce the Rh salt solution into the CeO₂ aqueous dispersion **slowly** using a syringe pump at a flow rate of **0.2 ml min⁻¹**, while the dispersion is under stirring. This creates the "aqueous mixture".
    *   **Initial Stirring:** Continue stirring the aqueous mixture (containing Rh³⁺ and CeO₂ nanorods) for an **additional 3 hours**.
    *   **pH Adjustment:** Carefully adjust the pH of the mixture to **9.5** by gradually adding ammonium hydroxide solution (Aldrich, 28%) under continuous stirring.
    *   **Aging:** After pH adjustment, continue stirring the mixture for an **additional 5 hours**.
    *   **Separation:** Centrifuge the mixture at **3,000 rpm for 5 minutes**. Decant and discard the supernatant (upper layer).
    *   **Drying:** Dry the solid product at **60 °C in an oven overnight**.
    *   **Calcination:** Calcinate the dried solid in a muffle furnace at **250 °C for 2 hours** to obtain the final **as-synthesized Rh₁/CeO₂ catalyst**.

**Key Confirmation:**
*   Inductively Coupled Plasma–Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) confirmed the Rh loading on the CeO₂ nanorods to be **0.17 wt%**, justifying the "Rh₁" notation (indicating atomically dispersed Rh) and the "0.17 wt% Rh/CeO₂" designation.

This synthesis involves a well-defined two-step process: first creating a tailored CeO₂ nanorod support hydrothermally, followed by the precise deposition and fixation of Rhodium single atoms onto this support via pH-controlled deposition-precipitation, finishing with a mild calcination step.
