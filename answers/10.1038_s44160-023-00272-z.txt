question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Synthesis of CNIO-GaSA x (x = 1, 2, 3) First, 800 mg of dicyandiamide was mixed with 500 μl of gallium nitrate aqueous solution of different concentrations (1.6, 3.2 and 8 g l –1 , for CNIO-GaSA 1 , CNIO-GaSA 2 and CNIO-GaSA 3 , respectively), and ground evenly until the solution was nearly dry. Then, the mixture was freeze-dried for 12 h. Afterwards, the product ( ∼ 0.8 g) was mixed with silica templates (1.33 g), and calcined in argon at 520 °C with a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1 for 2 h. The product was further heated to 550 °C with a ramp rate of 5 °C min −1 and kept at 550 °C for another 2 h. The as-obtained product was etched in NH4HF2 aqueous solution for 72 h to remove the silica template completely, before being washed with deionized water three times and dried under ambient conditions.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalyst synthesis procedure from the given paragraph. Let me analyze this carefully.

First, I need to identify what catalyst is being synthesized. The name is CNIO-GaSA x where x=1,2,3 - these appear to be gallium single-atom catalysts supported on nitrogen-doped carbon. The "x" denotes different gallium loadings based on the concentration of gallium nitrate solution used.

Looking at the synthesis steps: It starts with dicyandiamide (a common precursor for carbon nitride materials) mixed with gallium nitrate solutions of varying concentrations. The concentrations are specifically 1.6, 3.2 and 8 g/L for the three variants respectively. The grinding until near-dry suggests they're ensuring good mixing before freeze-drying.

Freeze-drying for 12 hours is crucial - this would create a homogeneous mixture with high surface area for subsequent reactions. Then they mix with silica templates (1.33g per 0.8g of precursor) which acts as a hard template for porosity control. 

The calcination process is detailed: 520°C for 2h in argon with 5°C/min ramp, then additional heating to 550°C for another 2h. This two-step pyrolysis likely converts the precursor to N-doped carbon while incorporating gallium atoms and using silica to shape the pore structure.

The etching step in NH4HF2 for 72 hours is critical - this removes the silica template completely without damaging the carbon structure. The final washing and drying are standard purification steps.

As a catalyst specialist, I notice several key points: The use of freeze-drying ensures uniform dispersion, the silica templating creates controlled porosity, and the mild pyrolysis conditions suggest they're aiming to stabilize single gallium atoms rather than form nanoparticles. The varying gallium concentrations allow tuning of metal loading while maintaining atomic dispersion.

The user seems to want all technical details preserved in the summary - concentrations, masses, temperatures, durations etc. I'll make sure to include every parameter while organizing it into clear procedural steps. Since they're asking as a fellow chemist, I can use precise terminology without oversimplifying.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here's a professional summary of the catalyst synthesized and its detailed synthesis procedure:

**Catalyst Synthesized:**
*   **Name:** CNIO-GaSA x (where x = 1, 2, 3)
*   **Composition:** Nitrogen-doped carbon (derived from dicyandiamide) supporting atomically dispersed Gallium (Ga) single atoms (SA). The "x" denotes different Gallium loadings controlled by the initial Ga(NO₃)₃ concentration.
*   **Morphology:** Porous structure templated by and subsequently liberated from silica nanoparticles via etching.

**Detailed Synthesis Procedure:**

1.  **Precursor Mixing & Homogenization:**
    *   800 mg of dicyandiamide (C₂H₄N₄) is placed in a vessel.
    *   500 µl of an aqueous gallium nitrate (Ga(NO₃)₃) solution is added. The concentration of this solution determines the Ga loading in the final catalyst:
        *   CNIO-GaSA 1: 1.6 g L⁻¹ Ga(NO₃)₃
        *   CNIO-GaSA 2: 3.2 g L⁻¹ Ga(NO₃)₃
        *   CNIO-GaSA 3: 8.0 g L⁻¹ Ga(NO₃)₃
    *   The mixture is manually ground using a mortar and pestle (or equivalent) until it becomes a near-dry, homogeneous solid mixture. This ensures intimate contact between the carbon/nitrogen precursor and the gallium source.

2.  **Freeze-Drying (Lyophilization):**
    *   The ground mixture from step 1 is subjected to freeze-drying.
    *   Duration: 12 hours.
    *   Purpose: To remove all water gently, preserving the mixed morphology and preventing agglomeration, resulting in a dry, porous precursor powder (~0.8 g).

3.  **Silica Templating & Primary Pyrolysis:**
    *   The freeze-dried powder (~0.8 g) is thoroughly mixed with 1.33 g of silica (SiO₂) nanoparticles (acting as a sacrificial hard template).
    *   This mixture is placed in a tube furnace.
    *   The furnace atmosphere is purged and maintained under **argon (Ar)** gas flow.
    *   The temperature is ramped from room temperature to **520 °C** at a controlled rate of **5 °C min⁻¹**.
    *   Once at 520 °C, the temperature is held (soaked) for **2 hours**.
    *   Purpose: Initial carbonization of dicyandiamide into N-doped carbon, decomposition/incorporation of gallium species, and structural templating by silica.

4.  **Secondary Pyrolysis:**
    *   Without cooling or changing atmosphere (still under Ar), the temperature is further increased.
    *   Ramp rate: **5 °C min⁻¹** from 520 °C to **550 °C**.
    *   The temperature is held at **550 °C** for another **2 hours**.
    *   Purpose: Further graphitization/stabilization of the carbon structure, final activation/incorporation of gallium as single atoms, and strengthening the composite.

5.  **Silica Template Removal (Etching):**
    *   The pyrolyzed product (now a carbon/gallium/silica composite) is removed from the furnace.
    *   It is immersed in an aqueous solution of ammonium bifluoride (NH₄HF₂). This solution dissolves silica (SiO₂).
    *   Etching Duration: **72 hours** (3 days).
    *   Purpose: To **completely remove** the silica template, leaving behind a porous N-doped carbon structure with atomically dispersed gallium.

6.  **Washing & Drying:**
    *   The etched product is washed thoroughly with **deionized (DI) water**.
    *   Washing is repeated **three times** to ensure complete removal of any residual NH₄HF₂, dissolved silica species (e.g., SiF₆²⁻), or other soluble byproducts.
    *   The final catalyst solid is dried under **ambient conditions** (room temperature and pressure).

**Key Synthesis Features:**
*   **Ga Loading Control:** Achieved via initial Ga(NO₃)₃ solution concentration (1.6, 3.2, 8.0 g L⁻¹).
*   **Porosity Creation:** Utilizes silica nanoparticle hard templating followed by prolonged etching.
*   **Single-Atom Stabilization:** Relies on the combination of nitrogen-rich precursor (dicyandiamide), freeze-drying for dispersion, controlled pyrolysis under inert atmosphere, and templating to create anchoring sites.
*   **Thermal Profile:** Two-stage pyrolysis (520°C/2h + 550°C/2h) under Ar with a slow ramp (5°C/min) to ensure controlled decomposition and incorporation.
