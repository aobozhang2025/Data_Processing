question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Preparation of TiNS TiNS were synthesized by solid-state calcination of TiO 2 :K 2 CO 3 :LiCO 3 in a mole ratio of 1.0:0.23:0.078 according to previously reported procedures 45 . The mixed powder was finely ground for 30 min and calcined in two steps: heating at 900 °C for 1 h and gentle grinding after natural cooling to room temperature, and heating at 1,000 °C for 20 h and natural cooling to room temperature. In both calcination steps, the temperature rose at 10 °C min −1 to reach the set point. The obtained layered parent microcrystals were washed three times with hot water to remove unreacted K 2 CO 3 and LiCO 3 . The washed K 0.8 Ti 1.73 Li 0.27 O 4 layered oxide was protonated by soaking in HCl solution (0.5 M) at room temperature for 3 days, and the solution was replaced daily with a fresh batch. To produce TiNS, the protonated titanate crystals (H 1.0 Ti 1.73 O 4 ) were dispersed in an aqueous solution of tetramethylam- monium hydroxide (TMAOH) and then shaken gently for 2 days. The molar ratio between TMAOH and the protonated solid was 1:1, and the solid-to-solution ratio was controlled at 4.0 mg ml −1 . To avoid the deleterious impact of TMAOH molecules in electrocatalytic applica- tions, TiNS was purified by adding an appropriate amount of Mg(NO 3 ) 2 (0.5 M). Then, the suspension was separated by centrifugation for 30 min at 1,610g at room temperature. The supernatant containing TMA + NO 3 − was discarded, and TiNS was collected as a precipitate. The precipitate was re-suspended in HCl (1 M) and sonicated for 30 min, to convert residual Mg(OH) 2 into MgCl 2 and remove it with the super- natant after centrifugation (2,862g). Finally, TiNS was dispersed in EG by a simple shaking process.

Preparation of perovskite-based photocathode ITO/glass substrates were treated with UV/ozone for 30 min and then transferred to a N 2 -filled glovebox with both H 2 O and O 2 levels below 0.1 ppm. A PTAA solution (2 mg ml −1 in toluene) was spin-cast at 4,000 rpm for 30 s, followed by heating at 100 °C for 15 min. After cool- ing to room temperature, a PFN-Br solution (0.5 mg ml −1 in methanol) was deposited onto the PTAA films. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving caesium iodide (CsI; 0.06 M), formami- dinium iodide (FAI; 1 M), methylammonium bromide (MABr; 0.2 M), lead iodide (PbI 2 ; 1.1 M), lead bromide (PbBr 2 ; 0.2 M) and oleylamine (0.1 wt.%) in 1 ml of dimethylformamide/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) mixed solvent (4/1, v/v). The perovskite layer was deposited using a two-step spin-coating procedure at 1,000 rpm for 5 s and then 5,000 rpm for 30 s. During the second step, 150 µl of chlorobenzene as an antisolvent was quickly dropped on the centre 10 s before the end of the whole spinning process. The film was annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. The perovskite film was coated with PMMA (1 mg ml −1 in ethyl acetate) and spun at 5,000 rpm before being heated at 100 °C for 5 min. The electron transporting layer was deposited by spin-casting a PC 61 BM solution (25 mg ml −1 in chlorobenzene) at 1,000 rpm for 30 s and a BCP solution (1 mg ml −1 in isopropyl alcohol) at 4,000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 150-nm-thick Ag electrode was deposited via thermal evaporation at <10 −6 Torr. Ru@TiNS was sprayed on a piece of CP. After drying, the Ru@ TiNS loaded on CP was connected to the Ni foil (0.6 cm × 0.6 cm, thick- ness ~0.1 mm, Alfa Aesar) with the silver (Ag) paste. This configuration was then attached to the Ag layer (top electrode of the perovskite solar cell) using FM, where it was melted at its melting point (62 °C), followed by cooling to room temperature according to a previous report 28 . The edges were then covered with epoxy resin. Finally, to complete the fabrication, small, enamelled piece of copper wire was connected to the samples via Ag paste, leaving them for at least 24 h to dry completely.

Preparation of Ru@TiNS and Pt@TiNS TiNS loaded with Ru and Pt (denoted as Ru@TiNS and Pt@TiNS, respec- tively) were prepared by a modified polyol method. An appropriate amount of RuCl 3 or H 2 PtCl 6 precursor was added to isolated TiNS to reach 25 wt.% Ru or 20 wt.% Pt. Typically, TiNS (200 mg) was first dispersed in EG (50 ml) by shaking. Then, the Ru precursor solution (103.13 mg RuCl 3 ·xH 2 O dissolved in 10 ml deionized water, equivalent to 50.25 mg of Ru) was added dropwise to TiNS dispersed in EG. In the case of Pt@TiNS, the Pt precursor solution (107.92 mg H 2 PtCl 6 ·6H 2 O

Preparation of the catalyst ink and working electrode To study the electrocatalytic performance, a uniform ink dispersion was prepared by sonicating 2.0 mg of the electrocatalyst in 0.95 ml ethanol and 0.05 ml Nafion solution (5 wt.%) for 30 min, followed by stirring for 10 h. The obtained ink was sprayed onto the surface (1.5 cm 2 ) of a clean carbon paper (CP) on a hotplate at 120 °C. The catalyst load- ing was accurately measured by weighting the CP with a microbalance with and without the electrocatalyst. The catalyst inks were sprayed onto one side of CP at a weight density of 1 mg cm −2 . Considering that the electrocatalyst contained 25 wt.% of Ru or 20 wt.% of Pt, the Ru or Pt mass density was about 0.25 and 0.2 mg cm −2 , respectively.

reasoning: 

Alright, the user wants me to summarize the catalyst synthesis from a complex paragraph. Let me start by breaking down the text. The main catalysts mentioned are Ru@TiNS and Pt@TiNS. The synthesis involves multiple steps, starting with TiNS preparation.

First, TiNS is made through solid-state calcination. The precursors are TiO₂, K₂CO₃, and LiCO₃ in a 1:0.23:0.078 mole ratio. The process includes grinding, two-step calcination at 900°C and 1000°C, washing, protonation with HCl, and exfoliation using TMAOH. Then purification with Mg(NO₃)₂ and HCl. The TiNS is dispersed in EG.

Next, Ru@TiNS and Pt@TiNS are prepared via a polyol method. RuCl₃ or H₂PtCl₆ precursors are added to TiNS in ethylene glycol. For Ru, it's 25 wt.% loading, using RuCl₃·xH₂O dissolved in water, added dropwise. Pt is similar but 20 wt.% with H₂PtCl₆·6H₂O. The mixtures are heated to 120°C under nitrogen, then centrifuged and washed. The catalysts are dried and stored as powders.

The user might be a chemist needing detailed synthesis steps for replication. They might also be interested in the electrocatalytic applications, given mentions of Nafion ink and carbon paper electrodes. The purification steps suggest sensitivity to contaminants in catalysis. Highlighting the exact conditions (temperatures, times, ratios) is crucial. Also, noting the removal of TMAOH and Mg residues is important for performance. Ensuring clarity on precursor handling and storage conditions would address unspoken needs for reproducibility and catalyst stability.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, the catalysts synthesized are **Ru@TiNS** and **Pt@TiNS**, which are **ruthenium-loaded titanium nanosheets** and **platinum-loaded titanium nanosheets**, respectively. The synthesis involves a multi-step process, starting with the synthesis of the TiNS support, followed by metal loading.

Here is a detailed summary of the synthesis procedures:

1.  **Synthesis of TiNS (Titanium Nanosheets) Support:**
    *   **Precursor Mixing:** TiO₂, K₂CO₃, and LiCO₃ are mixed in a molar ratio of 1.0:0.23:0.078.
    *   **Grinding:** The powder mixture is finely ground for 30 minutes.
    *   **Two-Step Calcination:**
        *   Step 1: Heated to 900 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C min⁻¹, held for 1 hour, then naturally cooled to room temperature. The product is gently ground.
        *   Step 2: Heated to 1000 °C at 10 °C min⁻¹, held for 20 hours, then naturally cooled to room temperature.
    *   **Washing:** The resulting layered microcrystals (K₀.₈Ti₁.₇₃Li₀.₂₇O₄) are washed three times with hot water to remove unreacted K₂CO₃ and LiCO₃.
    *   **Protonation:** The washed oxide is soaked in 0.5 M HCl solution at room temperature for 3 days, with the solution replaced daily, to form H₁.₀Ti₁.₇₃O₄.
    *   **Exfoliation:** The protonated titanate is dispersed in an aqueous solution of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH). The molar ratio of TMAOH to protonated solid is 1:1, and the solid concentration is 4.0 mg ml⁻¹. The mixture is gently shaken for 2 days to exfoliate the layers into nanosheets (TiNS).
    *   **Purification (TMAOH Removal):**
        *   An appropriate amount of 0.5 M Mg(NO₃)₂ solution is added to the TiNS suspension to precipitate TMAOH impurities.
        *   The suspension is centrifuged for 30 minutes at 1,610g. The supernatant (containing TMA⁺NO₃⁻) is discarded; the TiNS precipitate is collected.
    *   **Purification (Mg Removal):**
        *   The precipitate is re-suspended in 1 M HCl and sonicated for 30 minutes to convert residual Mg(OH)₂ to soluble MgCl₂.
        *   The suspension is centrifuged (2,862g) and the supernatant (containing MgCl₂) is discarded. The purified TiNS precipitate is collected.
    *   **Dispersion:** The purified TiNS is finally dispersed in ethylene glycol (EG) by shaking.

2.  **Synthesis of Ru@TiNS and Pt@TiNS Catalysts (Modified Polyol Method):**
    *   **Target Loading:** Ru@TiNS targets 25 wt.% Ru; Pt@TiNS targets 20 wt.% Pt.
    *   **Dispersion:** Isolated TiNS (200 mg) is dispersed in EG (50 ml) by shaking.
    *   **Precursor Addition:**
        *   **Ru@TiNS:** A solution of RuCl₃·xH₂O (103.13 mg, containing 50.25 mg Ru) dissolved in 10 ml deionized water is added dropwise to the TiNS/EG dispersion.
        *   **Pt@TiNS:** A solution of H₂PtCl₆·6H₂O (amount implied but not fully specified in the excerpt, targeting 20 wt.% Pt) is similarly added dropwise.
    *   **Reaction:** The mixture is heated to 120 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere and stirred at this temperature for 3 hours. This reduces the metal precursors and deposits Ru or Pt nanoparticles onto the TiNS.
    *   **Isolation:** After cooling to room temperature, the product is separated by centrifugation.
    *   **Washing:** The solid catalyst (Ru@TiNS or Pt@TiNS) is washed several times with a mixture of ethanol and water.
