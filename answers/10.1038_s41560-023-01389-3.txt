question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Preparation of 3D carbon The 3D carbon was prepared according to a literature procedure 32 . In brief, HY zeolite was first heated to 600 °C under a dry N 2 flow in a fused quartz reactor. Then, a mixture of ethylene gas and N 2 (volume ratio = 50:50) was passed through a water bubbler and fed into the zeolite bed at 600 °C for 30 min. The gas flow was switched to dry N 2

Electrochemical CO 2 reduction to ethanol The Sn-based tandem catalyst (denoted as SnS 2 /Sn 1 -O3G hereafter) was synthesized by a solvothermal method, the details of which are provided in Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2. Three-dimensional carbon foam derived from depositing ethylene onto a HY zeolite skeleton at 950 °C under ambient pressure was first prepared as the support to ensure a large surface area with good mass transport. Solvother- mal reaction was then carried out at 200 °C for 20 h to synthesize SnS 2 /Sn 1 -O3G, where SnBr 2 and thiourea were used as the Sn and S source, respectively. We first evaluated the electrochemical CO 2 RR performance of the SnS 2 /Sn 1 -O3G using chronoamperometry in an H-type cell filled with CO 2 -saturated 0.5 M KHCO 3 solution (Supplementary Figs. 3−8). Supplementary Fig. 5 provides typical current profiles obtained from the SnS 2 /Sn 1 -O3G, biased at various potentials from −0.6 to −1.1 V vs RHE in a CO 2 -saturated 0.5 M KHCO 3 solution. The gaseous and liquid products were analysed by an online gas chromatography and a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Supplementary Figs. 9–28). The results obtained from combination of geometric current density of the potentiostatic electrolysis of CO 2 over SnS 2 /Sn 1 -O3G and NMR spectral analysis (Supplementary Figs. 16–21) are presented in Fig. 1a,b. These data show that the catalyst reproducibly yielded ethanol with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) as high as 82.5% at −0.9 V RHE

Preparation of SnS 2 /Sn 1 -O3G The detailed preparation procedure of vertically aligned SnS 2 on Sn 1 -O3G is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 2 in which 2 mmol SnBr 2 and 2 mmol thiourea were added into a mixed solution containing 20 ml of oleic acid and 2.5 ml of oleyamine under magnetic stirring at 80 °C for 8 h (SnS 2 precursor solution). Meanwhile, 20 mg 3D carbon was dispersed into 10 ml of isopropanol under magnetic stirring at room temperature, followed by addition into the SnS 2 precursor solu- tion under magnetic stirring at room temperature for 2 h. Then, the obtained solution was transferred to a 100 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave to perform solvothermal reaction at 200 °C for 20 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the solid product was washed with ethanol and deionized water, collected by centrifugation and dried in a vacuum oven for 24 h at 40 °C for further utilization (SnS 2 /Sn 1 -O3G).

Preparation of single-Sn atom catalyst The SnS 2 /Sn 1 -O3G was successively leached at 80 °C in 2 M HCl for 24 h to remove SnS 2 nanosheets and unstable species (Sn 1 -O3G).

Preparation of SnS 2 Two mmol SnBr 2 and 2 mmol thiourea were added into a mixed solution containing 20 ml of oleic acid and 2.5 ml of oleyamine under magnetic stirring at 80 °C for 8 h. Then, the solution was transferred to a 100 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave to perform solvothermal reaction at 200 °C for 20 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the solid prod- uct was washed with ethanol and deionized water, collected by centrifuga- tion and dried in a vacuum oven for 24 h at 40 °C for further utilization.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalyst and its preparation from a technical paragraph. Let me carefully analyze the provided text.

Hmm, the main catalyst described is called SnS₂/Sn₁-O3G, which is a tin-based tandem catalyst for electrochemical CO₂ reduction to ethanol. The synthesis involves multiple steps that I need to extract clearly.

First, there's the support material preparation - a 3D carbon foam made by depositing ethylene onto HY zeolite at 950°C. Interesting that they modified the temperature from 600°C in the initial reference to 950°C for actual catalyst preparation. The support is crucial for providing large surface area and good mass transport.

Then comes the core catalyst synthesis through solvothermal method. Key reagents are SnBr₂ and thiourea as tin and sulfur sources, dissolved in oleic acid/oleylamine mixture. The 3D carbon support is added to this solution before solvothermal treatment at 200°C for 20 hours. Post-synthesis washing and drying steps seem standard but important for purity.

I notice they also describe how to make the single-atom catalyst variant (Sn₁-O3G) by acid leaching the tandem catalyst to remove SnS₂ nanosheets. And there's a separate procedure for pure SnS₂ synthesis without the carbon support.

The electrochemical performance part mentions impressive 82.5% Faradaic efficiency for ethanol production at -0.9V vs RHE. But since the user specifically asked about synthesis, I'll focus on preparation details.

The user seems to be a researcher needing precise technical details. I should present the synthesis procedures in logical order, highlighting critical parameters like temperatures, durations, reagent quantities, and all material names with their notations exactly as in the text. The acid leaching step for single-atom catalyst is particularly noteworthy as it creates a different catalytic structure.

Better include all components: support preparation, tandem catalyst synthesis, single-atom variant preparation, and reference SnS₂ synthesis for completeness. The quantities (like 2 mmol reagents) and solvent volumes must be exact since the user emphasized "all details".
