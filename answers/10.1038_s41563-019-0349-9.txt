question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Catalyst preparation. The synthesis of Pt iso catalysts on TiO 2 has been reported previously22. Briefly, a pH-adjusted solution (12.2) containing tetraammineplatinum(II) nitrate was slowly injected into a solution containing TiO 2 (anatase, 5 nm diameter, 290 m2 g−1, US Research Nanomaterials). After drying, the catalyst was calcined in a tube furnace at 450 °C for 4 h in flowing air after ramping up the temperature at a rate of 10 °C min−1.

reasoning: 

Alright, the user wants me to act as a chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalyst and its preparation from the given paragraph. Let me start by parsing the provided text carefully.

First, the catalyst mentioned is Pt on TiO2. The support is anatase TiO2 with specific properties: 5 nm particle diameter, 290 m²/g surface area, sourced from US Research Nanomaterials. The active metal is platinum, deposited as isolated atoms, which I infer from "Pt iso catalysts"—likely meaning single-atom or highly dispersed Pt. The synthesis method involves a pH-adjusted solution of tetraammineplatinum(II) nitrate. The pH is set to 12.2, which is quite basic. This solution is slowly injected into a TiO2 suspension. 

Next, the procedure steps: after injection, the mixture is dried. Then calcined in a tube furnace at 450°C for 4 hours in flowing air. The ramp rate is 10°C per minute. I need to note the importance of the basic pH here—it probably helps in anchoring Pt precursors to the TiO2 surface, preventing aggregation. The calcination step would decompose the platinum complex and oxidize it, likely forming PtOx species, which might be reduced later during catalyst activation, though that's not mentioned here. 

The user is likely a researcher or student needing detailed synthesis steps for replication. They might be preparing similar catalysts and require precise conditions like pH, temperature ramp, and calcination details. Maybe they're comparing methodologies or troubleshooting their own synthesis. I should ensure all parameters are explicitly stated: precursor compound, pH exact value, TiO2 specs, injection rate (though it's just noted as "slowly"), drying method isn't specified but calcination details are crucial. Highlighting the goal of achieving isolated Pt atoms is key since that affects catalytic properties. Also, mentioning the role of each step, like calcination for decomposition and dispersion, adds context. Need to avoid assumptions not in the text, like reduction steps. Double-checking all values: pH 12.2, 450°C, 4 hours, 10°C/min ramp. Got it.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here is a professional chemist's summary of the synthesized catalyst and its detailed synthesis procedure:

1.  **Synthesized Catalyst:**
    *   **Active Metal:** Platinum (Pt)
    *   **Support Material:** Titanium Dioxide (TiO₂)
    *   **Support Phase:** Anatase
    *   **Support Properties:** 5 nm average particle diameter, 290 m² g⁻¹ specific surface area (Supplier: US Research Nanomaterials).
    *   **Catalyst Type:** "Pt iso catalysts" (This strongly implies the synthesis aims for highly dispersed platinum, likely isolated single atoms (SACs) or very small clusters on the TiO₂ surface).

2.  **Detailed Synthesis Procedure:**

    1.  **Precursor Solution Preparation:**
        *   Prepare an aqueous solution of **tetraammineplatinum(II) nitrate** ([Pt(NH₃)₄](NO₃)₂).
        *   **Adjust the pH** of this platinum precursor solution to **12.2** (highly basic). (Note: This basic pH is crucial for controlling Pt deposition and dispersion).

    2.  **Support Suspension:**
        *   Prepare an aqueous suspension containing the **TiO₂ (anatase)** support nanoparticles.

    3.  **Deposition/Impregnation:**
        *   **Slowly inject** the pH-adjusted tetraammineplatinum(II) nitrate solution into the TiO₂ suspension.
        *   (Implied: Stirring/mixing occurs during injection to ensure uniform contact).

    4.  **Drying:**
        *   After the injection and mixing is complete, **dry** the resulting solid material. (The specific drying method - e.g., oven drying, rotary evaporation, spray drying - is not specified).

    5.  **Calcination:**
        *   Place the dried material in a **tube furnace**.
        *   **Ramp the temperature** from room temperature to the target calcination temperature at a **controlled rate of 10 °C min⁻¹**.
        *   **Hold** the material at the **final calcination temperature of 450 °C** for **4 hours**.
        *   Perform calcination under **flowing air** atmosphere.

**Key Synthesis Details & Implications:**

*   **Precursor:** Tetraammineplatinum(II) nitrate is chosen as it decomposes cleanly and the ammine ligands can aid in dispersion.
*   **pH Control (12.2):** This is critical. The high basic pH likely promotes strong electrostatic interaction or specific adsorption between the cationic [Pt(NH₃)₄]²⁺ complex and the TiO₂ surface (whose point of zero charge is around pH 6-7), facilitating high dispersion and potentially anchoring Pt species to form isolated atoms/clusters during calcination. It also helps prevent premature hydrolysis or precipitation.
*   **Slow Injection:** Ensures gradual addition of the Pt precursor, minimizing local concentration gradients that could lead to agglomeration.
*   **Calcination Conditions:**
    *   **450 °C:** High enough to decompose the platinum ammine complex and any residual nitrates, and to potentially strengthen the Pt-TiO₂ interaction.
    *   **Flowing Air:** Oxidizes the organic ligands and nitrates, likely resulting in oxidized Pt species (e.g., PtOₓ) initially. *Crucially, this oxidative calcination is often a key step in stabilizing isolated Pt atoms on oxide supports like TiO₂.*
    *   **Controlled Ramp (10 °C min⁻¹):** Prevents rapid decomposition or sintering that could occur with a faster temperature increase.

**Overall Goal:** The procedure is meticulously designed (pH, slow injection, oxidative calcination) to achieve a highly dispersed Pt catalyst on anatase TiO₂, specifically targeting "Pt iso" (isolated atoms or very small clusters), leveraging the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) achievable with TiO₂ under these conditions. The resulting catalyst after calcination likely contains oxidized Pt species (Pt⁺ or Pt²⁺), which would typically be reduced *in situ* prior to catalytic testing to activate the metal sites.
