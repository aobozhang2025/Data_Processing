question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Catalyst preparation. All carbon-supported gold catalysts were prepared by a previously reported wet impregnation method12. Activated carbon was initially ground to obtain a powder (150–200 mesh). The gold precursor, H[AuCl 4 ]·3H 2 O (Alfa Aesar, 20 mg, assay 49%), was dissolved in the organic solvent (2.7 ml). The gold precursor solution was then added dropwise, with stirring, to the activated carbon (0.99 g) to obtain a catalyst with a final metal loading of 1 wt.%. The resulting powder was dried at a temperature 5–10 °C higher than the boiling point of the solvent used for 16 h under a flow of N 2 . Wherever possible, extra dry solvents sealed under nitrogen were used. The Ru/C, Pt/C and Pd/C catalysts were prepared by the same wet impregnation procedure. In these cases, Ru(iii) acetylacetonate (Aldrich), Pd(ii) acetylacetonate (Aldrich) and Pt(ii) 2,4-pentanedionate (Alfa Aesar) were used as precursors.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalyst and procedures from a given paragraph. Let me carefully analyze this technical text.

First, I need to identify what catalysts are being synthesized. The paragraph describes carbon-supported gold catalysts prepared by wet impregnation, and mentions that Ru/C, Pt/C and Pd/C catalysts were also made using the same method. So we're dealing with four different metal catalysts: Au, Ru, Pt and Pd, all supported on activated carbon.

Looking at the synthesis details for Au/C: They start with activated carbon ground to 150-200 mesh powder. The gold precursor is H[AuCl4]·3H2O dissolved in organic solvent. Important details include the precursor assay (49%), mass used (20mg), solvent volume (2.7ml), and support mass (0.99g) to achieve 1 wt% loading. 

The procedure involves dropwise addition of precursor solution to carbon with stirring, followed by drying at 5-10°C above solvent's boiling point for 16h under N2 flow. They emphasize using extra dry solvents sealed under N2 when possible.

For the other catalysts, they use different precursors: Ru(III) acetylacetonate, Pd(II) acetylacetonate, and Pt(II) 2,4-pentanedionate. The wet impregnation procedure remains identical.

I should organize this information clearly, highlighting both the common procedure and the specific precursors for each metal. The drying conditions and nitrogen handling are critical for catalyst quality, so I'll emphasize those. Since the user is acting as a professional chemist, I'll maintain technical precision while ensuring readability.

The summary should cover: catalyst types, support preparation, precursor details, solution preparation, impregnation method, drying protocol, and special handling notes. I'll present this in a structured format that would be useful for laboratory replication.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here's a professional chemist's summary of the synthesized catalysts and the detailed synthesis procedure:

**Synthesized Catalysts:**
1.  **Au/C (Gold on Carbon):** 1 wt.% loading.
2.  **Ru/C (Ruthenium on Carbon):** Loading not specified, but prepared identically to Au/C.
3.  **Pt/C (Platinum on Carbon):** Loading not specified, but prepared identically to Au/C.
4.  **Pd/C (Palladium on Carbon):** Loading not specified, but prepared identically to Au/C.
*   *All catalysts use Activated Carbon (AC) as the support.*

**Synthesis Procedure: Wet Impregnation**

The procedure is identical for all four catalysts (Au/C, Ru/C, Pt/C, Pd/C), with the *only difference* being the metal precursor used. The detailed steps are:

1.  **Support Preparation:**
    *   Activated Carbon (AC) is ground to a fine powder.
    *   Particle size: 150-200 mesh (approximately 74-105 µm).

2.  **Precursor Solution Preparation:**
    *   The appropriate metal precursor is dissolved in a suitable organic solvent.
    *   **Specific Precursors:**
        *   **Au/C:** Hydrogen tetrachloroaurate trihydrate (H[AuCl₄]·3H₂O), assay 49%. Mass used: 20 mg. Solvent volume: 2.7 ml.
        *   **Ru/C:** Ruthenium(III) acetylacetonate (Ru(acac)₃).
        *   **Pd/C:** Palladium(II) acetylacetonate (Pd(acac)₂).
        *   **Pt/C:** Platinum(II) 2,4-pentanedionate (Pt(acac)₂).
    *   **Solvent Handling:** "Extra dry" solvents, sealed under nitrogen, are used whenever possible to minimize moisture.

3.  **Impregnation:**
    *   The prepared metal precursor solution is added **dropwise** to the ground activated carbon powder.
    *   Mass of AC used for Au/C: 0.99 g (calculated to achieve 1 wt.% Au loading).
    *   The mixture is **stirred** during the dropwise addition to ensure uniform distribution of the precursor solution onto the carbon support.

4.  **Drying:**
    *   The resulting impregnated powder is dried under a flowing nitrogen (N₂) atmosphere.
    *   Drying Temperature: 5–10 °C **higher than the boiling point** of the organic solvent used in step 2.
    *   Drying Time: 16 hours (overnight).

**Key Synthesis Details & Considerations:**

*   **Method:** Wet Impregnation (specifically, "incipient wetness" is implied by the precursor solution volume relative to support mass).
*   **Support:** Activated Carbon (AC), ground to 150-200 mesh.
*   **Critical Atmosphere Control:** Drying is performed under a **flowing N₂ atmosphere** to prevent oxidation or unwanted reactions. The preference for "extra dry solvents sealed under N₂" further emphasizes strict moisture and oxygen exclusion.
*   **Drying Conditions:** Elevated temperature (5-10°C above solvent BP) under inert gas ensures complete solvent removal and likely facilitates precursor decomposition/precursor-support interaction without excessive sintering.
*   **Metal Loading:** Explicitly stated as 1 wt.% for Au/C. Loading for Ru/C, Pt/C, Pd/C is not specified but follows the *same procedure*, implying the precursor mass was calculated for a specific target loading (likely also 1 wt.% or a comparable value).
*   **Precursor Specificity:** Precursors are chosen based on metal solubility and stability in organic solvents suitable for wet impregnation on carbon (chloride for Au, acetylacetonates for Ru, Pd, Pt).

This procedure results in dried catalyst precursors supported on activated carbon. Subsequent steps (like reduction, calcination, or activation) are not described in the provided text but are typically required before catalytic testing. The emphasis is on controlled precursor deposition and careful drying under inert conditions to achieve well-dispersed metal particles.
