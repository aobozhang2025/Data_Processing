question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Catalyst preparation. The initial experiments to investigate the role of atom-trapped Pt were performed with the commercial ceria (Solvay-Rhodia HS 5, also referred to as HSA ceria since it has a higher surface area than the ceria prepared by calcination of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 , which was used for the Pd–Pt catalysts). To prepare engineered CeO 2 , tetraamineplatinum nitrate solution was impregnated onto CeO 2 powder by conventional wet impregnation, followed by drying at 120 °C for 12 h. The powder was then calcined at 800 °C for 10 h in flowing air. The obtained materials were denoted as 1Pt@CeO 2 and 3Pt@CeO 2 , corresponding to the Pt loadings of 1 and 3 wt.%, respectively. The high temperature treatment causes a drop in BET surface area, from 135 m2 g−1 for the as-received ceria to 60 m2 g−1 for the pure ceria (PS ceria), 78 m2 g−1 for 1Pt@CeO 2 and 100 m2 g−1 for the 3Pt@CeO 2 sample. The Pt interacts strongly with the ceria surface, pinning defect sites and slowing the rate of ceria sintering26,35. The nucleation and growth of Pt on PS CeO 2 support (precalcined at 800 °C in air for 10 h) and the 1Pt@CeO 2 (subjected to a similar thermal treatment) helped identify the role of trapped Pt atoms during catalyst preparation. An appropriate amount of tetraamineplatinum nitrate (Pt(NH 3 ) 4 (NO 3 ) 2 ) was added to each support followed by drying at 120 °C for 12 h and calcination at 500 °C for 4 h in air. The total Pt loading for each catalyst was 3 wt.% Pt and the samples were denoted as 3 wt.%Pt/PS ceria and 2Pt/1Pt@CeO 2 . For the methane oxidation study, we used ceria powder prepared in the laboratory via decomposition of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 , as described in our previous work26. This ceria powder has a BET surface area of 85 m2 g−1 as prepared. To prepare the engineered catalyst support, we used 2 wt.% Pt via impregnation, drying in air, calcination at 500 °C following by ageing in air at 800 °C for 10 h. This catalyst support is denoted as 2Pt@CeO 2 . Palladium nitrate (1.09 wt.% Pd) was deposited on the 2Pt@CeO 2 by wet impregnation, followed by drying at 120 °C for 12 h and calcining at 500 °C for 4 h in air. The catalyst was denoted as 1Pd/2Pt@CeO 2 . To provide a comparison, we also prepared two reference samples of 1Pd/CeO 2 (1.09 wt.%Pd) and (1Pd + 2Pt)/CeO 2 containing the same loading of metal as the 1Pd/2Pt@CeO 2 . For the reference (1Pd + 2Pt)/CeO 2 catalyst (BET surface area 64 m2 g−1), the palladium(II) nitrate solution was impregnated onto the CeO 2 first, then dried at 120 °C in air for 12 h. After calcination at 500 °C in air for 4 h, tetraamineplatinum nitrate (2 wt.% Pt) was impregnated onto the material progressively, followed by drying at 120 °C for 12 h in air and calcining at 500 °C for 4 h in air. The reference 1Pd/CeO 2 (1.09 wt.%Pd) sample was prepared by impregnating appropriate amount of palladium(II) nitrate solution onto the CeO 2 . Then, the sample was obtained after drying at 120 °C in air for 12 h and calcining at 500 °C in air for 4 h. The morphological properties of this set of catalysts are shown in Supplementary Table 1.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalysts and procedures from a technical paragraph. Let me carefully analyze this dense materials science text.

First, I notice this describes several catalyst systems based on ceria (CeO₂) with platinum and palladium. The key catalysts mentioned are: Pt@CeO₂ materials, Pd-Pt bimetallics, and some reference samples. The synthesis methods involve multiple steps - impregnation, drying, calcination - with specific temperature and duration details.

Hmm, the user seems to be either a researcher or student needing a clear technical breakdown. They probably want this for lab replication or understanding the experimental design. The paragraph contains many material designations (like 1Pt@CeO₂) and cross-references to previous work (citation 26,35), so I should clarify these while maintaining precision.

Let me mentally organize this chronologically. First part is about Pt trapping studies: they start with commercial ceria (HSA), impregnate tetraamineplatinum nitrate, dry at 120°C, then high-temp calcination at 800°C to create Pt@CeO₂. Interesting how the Pt loading (1-3wt%) affects surface area preservation - that's probably why they emphasize BET measurements.

Then comes the comparative study where they pre-calcine supports before Pt addition. The notation gets tricky here with 3wt.%Pt/PS ceria versus 2Pt/1Pt@CeO₂ - I need to explain this nomenclature carefully. 

For methane oxidation catalysts, they switch to lab-made ceria from Ce(NO₃)₃ decomposition. The 2Pt@CeO₂ support preparation has different calcination/aging sequence. Then adding Pd via impregnation creates the 1Pd/2Pt@CeO₂ bimetallic catalyst. 

Ah, and the reference samples! The (1Pd + 2Pt)/CeO₂ sequential impregnation method versus co-impregnation in the main catalyst. This comparison is scientifically important for showing the "trapped Pt" effect. 

I should highlight how surface area changes (BET data) correlate with synthesis conditions. Also note how Pt "pins" ceria defects to reduce sintering - that's the core mechanism they're investigating. The user likely needs this mechanistic insight for their own work.

Better present this as a structured synthesis report with clear catalyst naming conventions. Since they're a chemist, I'll include all technical specs: precursors (tetraamineplatinum nitrate!), exact temps/hours, flow conditions. Might add a table for BET values later if they ask. 

*checks notes* Oh, and Supplementary Table 1 reference - should mention that morphological data exists elsewhere. User might follow up asking for those properties.

    *   **Calcination:** 500 °C for 4 hours in air. (BET = 64 m²/g).

**Key Observations:**
*   **Precursor:** Pt deposited exclusively via Tetraamineplatinum(II) nitrate (Pt(NH₃)₄(NO₃)₂).
*   **Precursor:** Pd deposited exclusively via Palladium(II) nitrate.
*   **Drying:** Consistently 120 °C for 12 hours in air.
*   **Calcination:** Lower temperature (500 °C for 4h in air) used for depositing active metals onto supports. High temperature (800 °C for 10h in air) used for Pt trapping and support ageing/stabilization.
*   **Atom Trapping:** The high-temperature (800°C) step is crucial for creating the "trapped" Pt state on ceria, which modifies support properties (reduces sintering).
*   **Bimetallic Catalyst Distinction:** **1Pd/2Pt@CeO₂** has Pd deposited *onto* a support where Pt is *already trapped*. The reference **(1Pd + 2Pt)/CeO₂** has Pd deposited first, calcined, *then* Pt deposited and calcined, both on plain CeO₂.
