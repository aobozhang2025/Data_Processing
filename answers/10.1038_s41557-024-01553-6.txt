question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Preparation of photocatalysts Unless otherwise stated, the purities of all reagents for photocatalyst preparation and for photoelectrochemical measurements are above the analytical grade. The pristine PCN was prepared according to the reported method 24 . In a typical synthesis of KPCN, 5.95 g of potassium bromide was added into the synthesis. Specifically, melamine (4.0 g, Alfa Aesar) was ground with KBr (5.95 g, Alfa Aesar) in 3 ml ethanol (Et-OH) and 1 ml glycol in an agate mortar for 1 h. After drying at 65 °C, the resultant mixture was heated to 560 °C for 4 h at a ramping rate of 2.2 °C min −1 in a tube furnace (inner diameter 4 cm) in N 2 atmos- phere (50 ml min −1 ). After cooling to room temperature, the bright yellow-green product was ball milled (400 rpm, 3 h) with ZrO 2 balls of Ф ≈ 0.4 mm in Et-OH. The sample was washed by boiling deion- ized water several times, collected by filtration and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 12 h. The AuPCN and AuKPCN were prepared by a chemical deposition method as follows: a certain amount of PCN or KPCN was dispersed in 26 ml water under sonication for 60 min at 60 °C, followed by adding a certain amount of HAuCl 4 . The mixture was then bubbled with N 2 for 30 min (100 ml min −1 ). The reaction system was carefully sealed and then heated to 60 °C for 8 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the sample was washed by deionized water and Et-OH several times, collected by filtration and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 12 h. The detailed orthogonal experimental results are discussed in the corresponding supplementary figures.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to summarize the catalyst synthesis procedures from a technical paragraph as if I were a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis. 

Hmm, this is clearly an academic or industrial researcher working with photocatalysts - probably in materials science or chemical engineering. They've provided a dense experimental section from what seems like a research paper. The level of detail suggests they need precise technical replication, not just a conceptual overview.

Let me break this down systematically. First, I identify there are three distinct catalysts being synthesized: pristine PCN, potassium-doped KPCN, and gold-modified versions (AuPCN/AuKPCN). The synthesis occurs in two phases - first the carbon nitride base materials, then gold deposition.

For the PCN/KPCN part, I note several critical parameters: the mortar grinding duration (1h), exact heating profile (560°C at 2.2°C/min ramp), atmosphere control (N2 flow rate 50ml/min), and post-treatment like ball milling specifications (400rpm, 0.4mm ZrO2 balls). The solvent mixture (EtOH + glycol) for grinding seems unusual - probably aids in homogeneous mixing. 

The gold deposition phase has equally specific conditions: sonication at 60°C, nitrogen purging (100ml/min), sealed reaction at 60°C for 8h. The HAuCl4 precursor suggests colloidal gold formation. Interesting they mention orthogonal experiments in supplements - implies optimization studies were done.

I should emphasize the material handling details too: vacuum drying, boiling water washes, filtration methods. These affect final catalyst properties like surface area or residual salts. The bright yellow-green product color change after heating is a useful visual indicator for synthesis success.

The user likely needs this for replicating work or writing methods sections. I'll structure the response with clear subheadings matching the synthesis stages, preserving all quantitative details while removing redundant phrases like "unless otherwise stated". Safety notes about high-temp furnaces and gold salts would be prudent additions.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here's a professional summary of the catalysts synthesized and their detailed synthesis procedures:

**Catalysts Synthesized:**
1.  **Pristine PCN (Polymeric Carbon Nitride):** The base catalyst.
2.  **KPCN (Potassium-doped Polymeric Carbon Nitride):** Potassium-modified PCN.
3.  **AuPCN (Gold-modified PCN):** Gold nanoparticles deposited on pristine PCN.
4.  **AuKPCN (Gold-modified KPCN):** Gold nanoparticles deposited on potassium-doped PCN (KPCN).

**Detailed Synthesis Procedures:**

**I. Synthesis of Pristine PCN (Reference Method):**
*   **Method:** Prepared according to a referenced method (Method 24). Specific details for *this* synthesis are not provided in the given paragraph.

**II. Synthesis of KPCN (Potassium-doped PCN):**
1.  **Grinding:**
    *   Combine melamine (4.0 g, Alfa Aesar, analytical grade) and potassium bromide (KBr, 5.95 g, Alfa Aesar, analytical grade) in an agate mortar.
    *   Add ethanol (Et-OH, 3 ml) and glycol (1 ml).
    *   Grind the mixture thoroughly for 1 hour.
2.  **Drying:**
    *   Dry the ground mixture at 65 °C.
3.  **Calcination:**
    *   Transfer the dried mixture to a tube furnace (inner diameter 4 cm).
    *   Heat under flowing nitrogen atmosphere (N₂, 50 ml min⁻¹).
    *   Ramp the temperature to 560 °C at a rate of 2.2 °C min⁻¹.
    *   Hold at 560 °C for 4 hours.
4.  **Cooling:**
    *   Allow the furnace to cool naturally to room temperature. The product is a bright yellow-green solid.
5.  **Ball Milling:**
    *   Transfer the cooled product to a ball mill.
    *   Add ethanol (Et-OH) as the milling medium.
    *   Mill using zirconia (ZrO₂) balls (diameter Ф ≈ 0.4 mm) at 400 rpm for 3 hours.
6.  **Washing:**
    *   Wash the ball-milled product by boiling it in deionized water several times.
7.  **Collection & Drying:**
    *   Collect the solid product by filtration.
    *   Dry the collected solid in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 hours.
    *   The final product is KPCN.

**III. Synthesis of AuPCN and AuKPCN (Gold Deposition):**
1.  **Dispersion:**
    *   Disperse a specific amount of either pristine PCN or synthesized KPCN in deionized water (26 ml).
    *   Sonicate the dispersion for 60 minutes at 60 °C.
2.  **Precursor Addition:**
    *   Add a specific amount of gold precursor (HAuCl₄) to the sonicated dispersion.
3.  **Deoxygenation:**
    *   Bubble nitrogen gas (N₂, 100 ml min⁻¹) through the mixture for 30 minutes to remove dissolved oxygen.
4.  **Reaction:**
    *   Carefully seal the reaction vessel.
    *   Heat the sealed mixture to 60 °C and maintain this temperature for 8 hours. (This allows gold reduction and deposition onto the PCN/KPCN support).
5.  **Cooling:**
    *   Allow the reaction mixture to cool down to room temperature.
6.  **Washing:**
    *   Wash the solid product several times with deionized water and ethanol (Et-OH).
7.  **Collection & Drying:**
    *   Collect the solid product by filtration.
    *   Dry the collected solid in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 hours.
    *   The final products are AuPCN (if PCN was used) or AuKPCN (if KPCN was used).

**Key Notes:**
*   **Reagent Purity:** All reagents used are specified to be at least analytical grade.
*   **Atmosphere Control:** Critical steps (calcination for KPCN, gold deposition for AuPCN/AuKPCN) are performed under inert nitrogen atmosphere.
*   **Optimization:** The amounts of PCN/KPCN and HAuCl₄ used are described as "a certain amount", indicating these were variables optimized in orthogonal experiments detailed in supplementary figures.
*   **Gold Deposition Method:** The gold modification is explicitly described as a "chemical deposition method".
*   **Post-Treatment:** Washing (especially boiling for KPCN) and vacuum drying are crucial final steps for all catalysts to remove impurities/salts and solvents. Ball milling is specific to KPCN to reduce particle size/improve dispersion.
