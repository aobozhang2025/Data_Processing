question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Synthesis of SACs The method used for synthesizing Co-SAC is based on our previ- ously reported method, with some modifications 36 . First, 1.0 g of o-phenylenediamine, 0.44 g of CoCl 2 and 2.0 g of SiO 2 nanoparti- cles (10–20 nm, Aldrich) templates were mixed together by using 20 ml 1.0 M HCl solution. Then, the mixed solution was sonicated for 0.5 h and stirred for another 0.5 h. Subsequently, 12 ml of 1.0 M HCl solution, which contains 3.0 g of ammonium peroxydisulfate, that is, (NH 4 ) 2 S 2 O 8 , was added dropwise into the above mixed solution with vigorous stirring. After polymerization in an ice bath for nearly one day, the mixture was dried using a rotary evaporator. Then, the dried powder was annealed under Ar atmosphere at 800 °C for 2 h. Finally, the product was treated by alkaline (2.0 M NaOH) and acid (2.0 M H 2 SO 4 ) leaching successively to remove SiO 2 nanoparticles templates and unstable Co-based species, respectively, to obtain the Co-SAC. We used the same method to prepare Ni-SAC. The only difference is that 0.405 g NiCl 2 ·6H 2 O and 1.0 g SiO 2 were used to syn- thesize Ni-SAC. Fe-SAC was obtained on the basis of our previous paper.

Synthesis of OCB catalysts OCB is synthesized on the basis of our previously reported method 7,45 . 2 g of commercially available XC-72 carbon (Vulcan XC-72, Fuel Cell Store) was added into a three-neck flask with 460 ml 70% HNO 3 solu- tion and 140 ml deionized water. The mixture was well stirred and refluxed at 80 °C for 24 h. The resulting slurry was washed with water and ethanol after natural cooling until the solution pH reached neu- tral, and the precipitate obtained was dried overnight at 80 °C in an oven.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalysts and procedures from the provided paragraph. Let me analyze this carefully.

First, I notice the text describes two distinct catalyst syntheses: Single-Atom Catalysts (SACs) and Oxidized Carbon Black (OCB). The SACs include cobalt, nickel, and iron variants, while OCB seems to be a carbon-based catalyst support material.

For the Co-SAC synthesis, the key steps involve: mixing precursors (o-phenylenediamine, CoCl₂, SiO₂ nanoparticles) in HCl, sonication and stirring, dropwise addition of oxidizing agent (ammonium peroxydisulfate in HCl), polymerization in ice bath, drying, high-temperature annealing in argon, and finally acid/base leaching to remove templates and unstable species. The nickel variant follows the same procedure with adjusted quantities.

The OCB synthesis appears simpler: oxidizing Vulcan XC-72 carbon in HNO₃/water mixture at 80°C for 24 hours, followed by extensive washing and drying.

The user seems to be requesting a technical summary, so I should maintain precise chemical terminology while making it digestible. They might be preparing for lab work or writing a review, so including exact quantities and conditions is crucial. 

I notice the iron SAC reference is incomplete - it just says "based on previous paper" without details. I should flag this limitation in my response. Also worth noting that the SiO₂ template method suggests creating highly dispersed metal sites, which is characteristic of SACs.

The OCB procedure clearly functionalizes carbon surfaces, probably creating oxygen groups that could serve as anchoring sites for catalysts. That might explain why it's mentioned alongside SACs - possibly used as a support.

I'll organize the response by catalyst type, preserving all critical parameters (temperatures, concentrations, times) while omitting redundant phrasing. The professional tone should reflect that of a synthetic chemist - precise but practical.

**Key Synthesis Details:**

*   **Sacrificial Template:** SiO₂ nanoparticles are used as a template for SAC formation, removed later by NaOH leaching.
*   **Polymer Precursor:** o-Phenylenediamine polymerizes around the template/metal ions using (NH₄)₂S₂O₈ as an oxidant.
*   **High-Temperature Annealing:** Critical step (800°C under Ar) to convert the polymer into N-doped carbon supporting the metal atoms.
*   **Selective Leaching:** Sequential NaOH (removes SiO₂) and H₂SO₄ (removes unstable metal NPs/aggregates) treatments are essential to isolate the single-atom sites in the SACs.
*   **Oxidative Functionalization:** Concentrated HNO₃ reflux introduces oxygen-containing functional groups (e.g., -COOH, -OH) onto the carbon black surface to create OCB.
*   **Precursor Specifics:** NiCl₂ is used as the hexahydrate (NiCl₂·6H₂O) for Ni-SAC, while anhydrous CoCl₂ is used for Co-SAC. Quantities differ slightly. Fe-SAC synthesis is not described.
