question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Synthesis of SACs The method used for synthesizing Co-SAC is based on our previ- ously reported method, with some modifications 36 . First, 1.0 g of o-phenylenediamine, 0.44 g of CoCl 2 and 2.0 g of SiO 2 nanoparti- cles (10–20 nm, Aldrich) templates were mixed together by using 20 ml 1.0 M HCl solution. Then, the mixed solution was sonicated for 0.5 h and stirred for another 0.5 h. Subsequently, 12 ml of 1.0 M HCl solution, which contains 3.0 g of ammonium peroxydisulfate, that is, (NH 4 ) 2 S 2 O 8 , was added dropwise into the above mixed solution with vigorous stirring. After polymerization in an ice bath for nearly one day, the mixture was dried using a rotary evaporator. Then, the dried powder was annealed under Ar atmosphere at 800 °C for 2 h. Finally, the product was treated by alkaline (2.0 M NaOH) and acid (2.0 M H 2 SO 4 ) leaching successively to remove SiO 2 nanoparticles templates and unstable Co-based species, respectively, to obtain the Co-SAC. We used the same method to prepare Ni-SAC. The only difference is that 0.405 g NiCl 2 ·6H 2 O and 1.0 g SiO 2 were used to syn- thesize Ni-SAC. Fe-SAC was obtained on the basis of our previous paper.

Synthesis of OCB catalysts OCB is synthesized on the basis of our previously reported method 7,45 . 2 g of commercially available XC-72 carbon (Vulcan XC-72, Fuel Cell Store) was added into a three-neck flask with 460 ml 70% HNO 3 solu- tion and 140 ml deionized water. The mixture was well stirred and refluxed at 80 °C for 24 h. The resulting slurry was washed with water and ethanol after natural cooling until the solution pH reached neu- tral, and the precipitate obtained was dried overnight at 80 °C in an oven.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalysts and procedures from a technical paragraph. Let me analyze this carefully.

First, I see two distinct catalyst syntheses described: SACs (Single-Atom Catalysts) and OCB catalysts. For the SACs, there are three variations mentioned - Co-SAC, Ni-SAC, and Fe-SAC. The paragraph provides detailed procedures for Co and Ni, while Fe references previous work. 

Breaking down the Co-SAC synthesis: It starts with mixing o-phenylenediamine, CoCl₂, and SiO₂ nanoparticles in HCl. The sonication and stirring steps likely ensure proper dispersion. Then ammonium persulfate in HCl is added dropwise - this probably initiates polymerization. The ice bath polymerization over a day suggests a controlled exothermic reaction. After rotary evaporation, high-temperature annealing under argon creates the carbon-supported structure. The critical leaching steps with NaOH and H₂SO₄ remove the silica template and unstable cobalt species, leaving isolated cobalt atoms.

For Ni-SAC, the procedure is identical except for the nickel precursor (NiCl₂·6H₂O) and slightly different SiO₂ quantity. The OCB catalyst synthesis is simpler - it's acid functionalization of Vulcan carbon using nitric acid reflux. The extended washing is crucial to remove residual acid.

The user seems to need precise technical details - perhaps for replication or comparison studies. I should ensure all masses, concentrations, temperatures and times are accurately extracted. The modifications from previous methods (referenced as 36,7,45) might be important for their research context. Since they specified "all details", I'll include even minor steps like sonication duration and pH monitoring during washing.

Notably, the Fe-SAC lacks detailed procedure here - I should explicitly state that it follows prior work without new modifications. The professional summary should highlight the catalyst types (single-atom vs carbon support), key steps (template removal, leaching), and distinguish between the fully described vs referenced methods.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here is a professional chemist's summary of the catalysts synthesized and their detailed procedures:

**1. Single-Atom Catalysts (SACs): Co-SAC, Ni-SAC, Fe-SAC**
*   **Catalyst Type:** Carbon-supported Single-Atom Catalysts (SACs) where isolated metal atoms (Co, Ni, Fe) are coordinated to a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix. Silica nanoparticles serve as a sacrificial template.
*   **General Synthesis Principle:** Polymerization of o-phenylenediamine around metal ions and SiO₂ templates, followed by carbonization and template/metal impurity removal.
*   **Detailed Synthesis Procedure (Explicit for Co-SAC & Ni-SAC):**
    1.  **Mixing Precursors:** Combine in 20 ml of 1.0 M HCl:
        *   1.0 g o-phenylenediamine (monomer)
        *   Metal Salt:
            *   Co-SAC: 0.44 g CoCl₂
            *   Ni-SAC: 0.405 g NiCl₂·6H₂O
        *   Template:
            *   Co-SAC: 2.0 g SiO₂ nanoparticles (10-20 nm)
            *   Ni-SAC: 1.0 g SiO₂ nanoparticles (10-20 nm)
    2.  **Dispersion:** Sonicate the mixture for 0.5 hours.
    3.  **Stirring:** Stir the mixture for an additional 0.5 hours.
    4.  **Oxidative Polymerization Initiator:** Prepare a solution of 3.0 g ammonium peroxydisulfate ((NH₄)₂S₂O₈) in 12 ml of 1.0 M HCl.
    5.  **Initiation:** Add the ammonium peroxydisulfate/HCl solution dropwise to the main mixture **with vigorous stirring**.
    6.  **Polymerization:** Transfer the mixture to an ice bath and allow polymerization to proceed for approximately 24 hours (nearly one day).
    7.  **Drying:** Remove the solvent using a rotary evaporator to obtain a dried powder.
    8.  **Carbonization:** Anneal the dried powder under an inert Argon (Ar) atmosphere at 800 °C for 2 hours.
    9.  **Template Removal (Alkaline Leaching):** Treat the annealed product with 2.0 M NaOH solution to dissolve and remove the SiO₂ nanoparticle templates.
    10. **Unstable Metal Removal (Acid Leaching):** Treat the NaOH-leached product with 2.0 M H₂SO₄ solution to dissolve and remove unstable (e.g., metallic nanoparticles, clusters) or poorly coordinated metal-based species.
    11. **Final Product:** The resulting material after washing and drying is the desired Single-Atom Catalyst (Co-SAC or Ni-SAC).
*   **Fe-SAC Synthesis:** Synthesized based on a previously reported method (referenced paper), without new modifications described in this text.

**2. Oxidized Carbon Black (OCB) Catalyst**
*   **Catalyst Type:** Acid-functionalized carbon black support (Vulcan XC-72).
*   **Synthesis Principle:** Oxidative treatment of carbon black with nitric acid to introduce oxygen-containing surface functional groups (e.g., -COOH, -OH).
*   **Detailed Synthesis Procedure:**
    1.  **Acid Reflux Setup:** Add 2.0 g of Vulcan XC-72 carbon black to a three-neck flask.
    2.  **Acid Mixture Addition:** Pour 460 ml of 70% HNO₃ solution and 140 ml of deionized water into the flask with the carbon.
    3.  **Mixing:** Stir the mixture well to ensure dispersion.
    4.  **Oxidation:** Reflux the mixture at 80 °C for 24 hours.
    5.  **Cooling:** Allow the mixture to cool naturally to room temperature.
    6.  **Washing:** Wash the resulting slurry repeatedly with deionized water and ethanol until the filtrate reaches a neutral pH (pH ~7).
    7.  **Drying:** Collect the washed precipitate (solid) and dry it overnight in an oven at 80 °C.
    8.  **Final Product:** The dried material is the Oxidized Carbon Black (OCB) catalyst.

**Key Differences Highlighted:**
*   **SACs:** Involve complex polymerization, metal coordination, templating, high-temperature carbonization, and selective leaching to create isolated metal sites on N-doped carbon.
*   **OCB:** Involves a direct oxidation (functionalization) of pre-existing carbon black material under reflux conditions, followed by thorough washing. No metal is added, and no high-temperature step is involved.
