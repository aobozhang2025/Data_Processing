question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Preparation of M/support by wet impregnation In the preparation of M/support by wet impregnation, M represents ruthenium, palladium or platinum, while the supports were the com- mercial oxide or prepared as described above. Taking the preparation of ruthenium-based catalyst as an example, 0.995 g support and 335 μl ruthenium(III) nitrosyl nitrate solution was dispersed in 30 ml deion- ized water and stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The suspension was stirred in a 50 °C waterbath until no water was visible (about 8 h), then dried at 60 °C overnight. The solid was calcined at 350 °C for 3 h to obtain the final catalysts: Ru/SiO 2 , Ru/Al 2 O 3 , Ru/TiO 2 (P), Ru/TiO 2 (a), Ru/Ti(P)/Mn, Ru/Ti/Si, and Ru/Ti/Al. Palladium- and platinum-based catalysts were prepared by the same method, except that the ruthenium precursor is replaced by palladium nitrate or chloroplatinic acid. The theoretical loading content of noble metals was 0.5 wt.%. The prepa- ration details of the CuZnAl catalyst are shown in the Supplementary Information.

Methods Preparation of MnO x support MnO x support was prepared by the solvent-free method 54 . Potassium permanganate and manganese acetate tetrahydrate (Mn 7+ :Mn 2+ = 2:3) were mixed and ground in a mortar for 20 min to obtain a taupe mix- ture. Then the mixture was transferred to an oven for solid-phase reaction at 80 °C for 4 h. The resulting solid was washed with deionized water and filtered until the filtrate was colourless and transparent. The filter residue was dried at 60 °C overnight and calcined in a muffle furnace at 450 °C for 3 h to obtain MnO x . The details of materials and chemicals are summarized in the Supplementary Information.

Preparation of TiO 2 -oxide support TiO 2 was added by the following method to different oxide supports, namely, MnO x , SiO 2 or Al 2 O 3 . Suspension A was obtained by adding 1.00 g metal oxide, 200 ml anhydrous ethanol and 20 ml ammonium hydroxide in order in a flask and stirring vigorously for 30 min. Suspen- sion B was obtained by slowly dissolving 0.5 ml butyl titanate in 50 ml anhydrous ethanol and dripping it into suspension A. Suspension B continued to be stirred for 2 h, and after filtration, the filter residue was washed with anhydrous ethanol three times and dried at 60 °C overnight. The final sample (Ti/Mn, Ti/Si or Ti/Al) was obtained by calcining at 450 °C for 3 h. The preparation details of the commercial TiO 2 as the precursor of the TiO 2 -oxide (Ti(a)/Mn or Ti(P)/Mn) catalyst support are shown in the Supplementary Information.

reasoning: 

Alright, let me approach this systematically. The user wants a chemist's summary of catalyst synthesis procedures from the provided text. As a catalyst synthesis specialist, I need to extract three core preparation methods while maintaining technical accuracy.

First, I identify the key sections: noble metal catalysts on supports (Ru/Pd/Pt), MnOx support synthesis, and TiO2-modified supports. The wet impregnation method for noble metals is clearly described with Ru as the example - I note the precise masses (0.995g support, 335μl Ru precursor), solvent volume (30ml H2O), and thermal parameters (50°C evaporation, 60°C drying, 350°C calcination). The Pd/Pt variations with different precursors (nitrate/chloroplatinic acid) and consistent 0.5wt% loading are important to highlight.

For the MnOx support, the solvent-free approach stands out. The molar ratio (Mn7+:Mn2+=2:3) and physical mixing process (20min grinding) are critical. The solid-phase reaction at 80°C followed by thorough washing and higher calcination (450°C) differs from the metal catalyst preparation - this contrast should be emphasized.

The TiO2 deposition method is more complex. I need to clearly distinguish the two suspension steps: Suspension A (metal oxide in ethanol/NH4OH) and Suspension B (butyl titanate addition). The post-treatment details (ethanol washing, 60°C drying, 450°C calcination) mirror the MnOx process. The naming conventions like Ti/Mn and Ti(P)/Mn require explanation based on preparation routes.

Throughout, I'll maintain precise terminology (e.g., "calcined" not "baked", "precursor" not "starting material") while organizing the flow by synthesis type. The exclusions (CuZnAl, commercial TiO2 details) will be noted per the text's direction to supplementary data. The summary will structurally mirror the experimental procedures while adding contextual clarity about catalyst identities.
