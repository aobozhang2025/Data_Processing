question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Synthesis of catalysts. γ-Al 2 O 3 (1 g) was dispersed in 20 ml ethanol. A 1.25 ml dark brown solution of RuCl 3 (40 μmol ml–1) in water was then added dropwise to the dispersion. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 h, then centrifuged and redispersed in 30 ml H 2 O. NaOH (1 M) or NH 3 ·H 2 O (30%) was added dropwise to adjust the pH value to ~9–10. The mixture was kept stirring for another 20 h at room temperature. The mixture was then centrifuged and washed with 50 ml water and ethanol three times before dried under vacuum at 60 °C overnight. The as-obtained samples were denoted as Ru(Na)/Al 2 O 3 and Ru(H)/Al 2 O 3 , respectively (Ru(Na) and Ru(H)). The ruthenium contents were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS ×7,700) to be 0.45 wt% and 0.43 wt% in Ru(Na) and Ru(H), respectively. The sodium content was determined by XRF S8 Tiger. No reliable sodium signal was detected on Ru(H). For Ru(Na), the sodium content was 1.2 wt%, ~1.7 sodium ions per nm–2. Ru(OH) 3 was prepared by deposition of RuCl 3 in H 2 O and dried under vacuum at 80 °C overnight50.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize a specific catalyst synthesis procedure from a provided paragraph. Let me carefully analyze this technical text.

First, I need to identify the core components: the support material is γ-Al₂O₃ (gamma alumina), and the active metal is ruthenium. The synthesis involves two variants - one using NaOH and another using NH₃·H₂O as precipitating agents. 

The procedure starts with dispersing alumina in ethanol, then adding aqueous RuCl₃ solution dropwise. After stirring, they adjust pH to 9-10 using either sodium hydroxide or ammonia water. This pH adjustment is crucial as it likely converts Ru³⁺ to Ru(OH)₃ on the support surface. 

I notice important details about the workup: centrifugation, washing cycles with water and ethanol, and vacuum drying at 60°C. The naming convention Ru(Na)/Al₂O₃ and Ru(H)/Al₂O₃ clearly distinguishes the two catalysts based on the base used. 

The characterization data is significant - ICP-MS shows nearly identical Ru loading (~0.44 wt%), while XRF reveals sodium contamination only in the NaOH-prepared catalyst (1.2 wt%). This sodium content is quantified as ~1.7 Na⁺ ions per nm², which might affect catalytic properties. 

The user seems to need a precise, technical summary - probably for research replication purposes. I should emphasize the critical steps: pH-controlled precipitation, thorough washing to remove counterions, and the characterization methods used. The sodium contamination observation is particularly noteworthy for catalyst performance considerations. 

I'll structure the response to first state what was synthesized, then detail the procedure step-by-step, and finally highlight the analytical results. The comparison between the two preparation methods and the unintended sodium incorporation in one variant should be clearly explained since this may significantly impact catalytic behavior.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here's a professional summary of the synthesized catalysts and their detailed synthesis procedures:

**Synthesized Catalysts:**
1.  **Ru(Na)/Al₂O₃:** A ruthenium hydroxide catalyst supported on γ-Al₂O₃, precipitated using NaOH. Contains ~0.45 wt% Ru and ~1.2 wt% Na.
2.  **Ru(H)/Al₂O₃:** A ruthenium hydroxide catalyst supported on γ-Al₂O₃, precipitated using NH₃·H₂O. Contains ~0.43 wt% Ru and no detectable sodium.
3.  **Reference Material: Ru(OH)₃:** Unsupported ruthenium hydroxide prepared by drying an aqueous RuCl₃ solution.

**Detailed Synthesis Procedures:**

1.  **Impregnation:**
    *   Disperse 1.0 gram of γ-Al₂O₃ support in 20 ml of absolute ethanol.
    *   Prepare a dark brown aqueous solution of RuCl₃ at a concentration of 40 µmol/ml (micromoles per milliliter).
    *   Add 1.25 ml of this RuCl₃ solution dropwise to the γ-Al₂O₃/ethanol dispersion.
    *   Stir the resulting mixture at room temperature (RT) for 3 hours.

2.  **Phase Transfer & pH Adjustment:**
    *   Centrifuge the mixture from step 1.
    *   Redisperse the solid pellet in 30 ml of deionized water (H₂O).
    *   **For Ru(Na)/Al₂O₃:** Add 1 M NaOH solution dropwise to the aqueous dispersion while stirring, adjusting the pH to approximately 9-10.
    *   **For Ru(H)/Al₂O₃:** Add 30% NH₃·H₂O (ammonium hydroxide) solution dropwise to the aqueous dispersion while stirring, adjusting the pH to approximately 9-10.

3.  **Precipitation & Aging:**
    *   Maintain the pH-adjusted mixture (now at pH ~9-10) under stirring at room temperature for 20 hours. This step allows the hydrolysis/precipitation of ruthenium species (likely forming Ru(OH)₃) onto the alumina support.

4.  **Workup (Centrifugation, Washing, Drying):**
    *   Centrifuge the aged mixture to isolate the solid catalyst.
    *   Wash the solid pellet thoroughly: Resuspend in 50 ml deionized water, centrifuge. Repeat this water wash twice more (total of 3 water washes).
    *   Wash the solid pellet thoroughly: Resuspend in 50 ml ethanol, centrifuge. Repeat this ethanol wash twice more (total of 3 ethanol washes).
    *   Dry the washed solid under vacuum at 60 °C overnight.

5.  **Characterization:**
    *   Ruthenium content determined by ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry, instrument model 7700): Ru(Na)/Al₂O₃ = 0.45 wt%, Ru(H)/Al₂O₃ = 0.43 wt%.
    *   Sodium content determined by XRF (X-ray Fluorescence, instrument model S8 Tiger):
        *   Ru(H)/Al₂O₃: No reliable sodium signal detected.
        *   Ru(Na)/Al₂O₃: 1.2 wt% Na, corresponding to approximately 1.7 sodium ions per square nanometer (nm⁻²) of alumina surface.

**Reference Material Synthesis (Ru(OH)₃):**
*   Dissolve RuCl₃ in deionized water (H₂O).
*   Dry the resulting aqueous solution directly under vacuum at 80 °C overnight. This yields unsupported Ru(OH)₃.

**Key Observations:**
*   The core synthesis involves **impregnating γ-Al₂O₃ with RuCl₃ in ethanol**, followed by a **pH-controlled hydrolysis/precipitation (pH 9-10) in water** using either NaOH or NH₃·H₂O to form supported Ru(OH)₃.
*   **Extensive washing (3x water, 3x ethanol)** is crucial to remove soluble salts and precursors.
*   **NaOH introduction leads to significant sodium contamination** (1.2 wt%) in the final Ru(Na)/Al₂O₃ catalyst, while **NH₃·H₂O does not** introduce detectable sodium into Ru(H)/Al₂O₃.
*   Ruthenium loadings are very similar (~0.44 wt%) for both supported catalysts.
