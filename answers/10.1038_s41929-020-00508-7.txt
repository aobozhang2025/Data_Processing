question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Catalyst preparation. Commercial ceria (MEL) was calcined at 700 °C for 5 h to reduce the number of defect sites and trigger the formation of {111} facets (Supplementary Table 5). Robot-controlled incipient wetness impregnation was performed using an Accelerator SLT106 Parallel Synthesizer (SLT CATIMPREG, ChemSpeed Technologies)58. First, 1 g ceria was placed in a batch reactor, then 0.16 ml of a 25.8 × 10−3 M tetraammineplatinum(II) nitrate (99.995%, Sigma-Aldrich) aqueous solution was added and dried under reduced pressure for 20 min at 70 °C. This step was repeated, until the desired weight loading of Pt was achieved. The Pt/CeO 2 catalyst, denoted as Pt-single site (Pt-SS), was first calcined at 500 °C for 5 h and then hydrothermally (10% O2 and 10% H2O in N2) treated at 800 °C for 16 h. The catalyst was cooled in steam to ~200 °C, and then in 10% O2/N2 to room temperature. For comparison, the same catalyst was subsequently reduced in 2% H2 for 30 min at 400 °C to generate reduced Pt nanoparticles (Pt-NP). For the catalytic tests and X-ray-based characterization, Pt-NP was prepared in situ directly before the measurements

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis. They've provided a technical paragraph describing a catalyst preparation procedure and want me to summarize both the catalyst synthesized and the detailed synthesis procedures. 

First, I need to identify exactly what catalyst is being made. The paragraph mentions "Pt/CeO₂ catalyst" with two forms: "Pt-single site (Pt-SS)" and reduced "Pt nanoparticles (Pt-NP)". So the core catalyst is platinum supported on ceria, but with controlled morphology - either atomically dispersed Pt or nanoparticle form.

Now for the synthesis details, I should break this down step by step. The support preparation comes first: commercial ceria is calcined at 700°C for 5 hours to reduce defects and form specific {111} facets. Then the impregnation method is quite precise - robot-controlled incipient wetness using a specific machine (Accelerator SLT106). The Pt precursor is tetraammineplatinum(II) nitrate solution, added in small aliquots (0.16ml per dose) to 1g ceria with drying under vacuum at 70°C between additions. This incremental loading continues until target Pt weight percentage is reached.

Post-impregnation treatment differs for the two catalyst forms. For Pt-SS: first calcination at 500°C/5h, then harsh hydrothermal treatment at 800°C for 16h in 10% O₂ + 10% H₂O/N₂, followed by controlled cooling. For Pt-NP: they take the Pt-SS material and reduce it in 2% H₂ at 400°C for 30 minutes. The text notes Pt-NP is usually made in situ before characterization.

The user seems to need this for professional purposes - maybe replicating the synthesis or writing a report. I should highlight critical parameters like temperatures, atmospheres, and equipment specifics since those often determine reproducibility. The facet engineering of ceria and the precise Pt loading method are particularly noteworthy scientific details. I'll organize this clearly with catalyst identification first, then procedural phases, while preserving all technical nuances from the source text.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here's a professional summary of the synthesized catalyst and its detailed synthesis procedure:

**1. Synthesized Catalyst:**
*   **Core Material:** Platinum supported on Ceria (Pt/CeO₂).
*   **Two Distinct Forms Synthesized:**
    *   **Pt-single site (Pt-SS):** Platinum stabilized as atomically dispersed species on the ceria support. Achieved via high-temperature hydrothermal treatment.
    *   **Pt nanoparticles (Pt-NP):** Platinum in the form of nanoparticles on ceria. Generated by reducing the Pt-SS catalyst.

**2. Detailed Synthesis Procedure:**

The synthesis involves several key stages:

*   **A. Ceria Support Pretreatment:**
    *   **Material:** Commercial ceria (source: MEL).
    *   **Process:** Calcination.
    *   **Conditions:** 700 °C for 5 hours.
    *   **Purpose:** Reduce defect sites and promote the formation of thermodynamically stable {111} facets.

*   **B. Platinum Deposition (Impregnation):**
    *   **Method:** Robot-controlled Incipient Wetness Impregnation (IWI).
    *   **Equipment:** Accelerator SLT106 Parallel Synthesizer (SLT CATIMPREG module, ChemSpeed Technologies).
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Place 1.0 gram of the pretreated ceria into a batch reactor.
        2.  Add 0.16 ml of a Tetraammineplatinum(II) nitrate aqueous solution (concentration: 25.8 × 10⁻³ M, purity: 99.995%, source: Sigma-Aldrich).
        3.  Dry the impregnated material under reduced pressure (vacuum) for 20 minutes at 70 °C.
        4.  **Repeat** steps 2 and 3 (adding 0.16 ml solution and drying) until the desired total platinum weight loading is achieved. (The number of repetitions determines the final Pt loading).

*   **C. Formation of Pt-Single Site (Pt-SS) Catalyst:**
    *   **Step 1: Calcination:**
        *   **Conditions:** 500 °C for 5 hours.
    *   **Step 2: Hydrothermal Treatment:**
        *   **Atmosphere:** 10% O₂ and 10% H₂O in N₂ balance.
        *   **Temperature:** 800 °C.
        *   **Duration:** 16 hours.
    *   **Step 3: Controlled Cooling:**
        *   **Phase 1:** Cool the catalyst in steam down to approximately 200 °C.
        *   **Phase 2:** Further cool the catalyst in 10% O₂/N₂ down to room temperature.
    *   **Result:** The Pt-SS catalyst is obtained.

*   **D. Formation of Pt-Nanoparticles (Pt-NP) Catalyst:**
    *   **Starting Material:** The Pt-SS catalyst (from step C).
    *   **Process:** Reduction.
    *   **Atmosphere:** 2% H₂ (balance gas not specified, assumed inert like N₂ or Ar).
    *   **Temperature:** 400 °C.
    *   **Duration:** 30 minutes.
    *   **Result:** Reduction of atomically dispersed Pt species to form Pt nanoparticles (Pt-NP).
    *   **Note for Characterization:** For catalytic tests and X-ray characterization, the Pt-NP catalyst was typically prepared *in situ* immediately before the measurements using this reduction procedure on the Pt-SS material.

**Key Synthesis Details Emphasized:**

*   Incremental addition and drying of the Pt precursor solution to achieve target loading.
*   Specific thermal and atmospheric treatments (calcination, hydrothermal, reduction) to engineer the Pt state (single-site vs. nanoparticle).
*   Critical cooling protocols after hydrothermal treatment to stabilize the Pt-SS structure.
*   Defined reduction conditions to generate Pt-NP from Pt-SS.
