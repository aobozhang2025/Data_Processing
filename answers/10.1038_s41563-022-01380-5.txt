question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Synthesis of catalysts In a typical procedure, 0.1721 g of RuCl 3 and 0.0656 g of NiCl 2 ·6H 2 O (that is, RuCl 3 and NiCl 2 at a molar ratio of 3:1) were mixed in 150 ml of 1 M HCl and sonicated for 2 h. Carbon black (0.4 g; Cabot, BP2000) was then added and dispersed by stirring for 18 h under room temperature to ensure uniform distribution. Next, the mixture was dried by using a rotary evaporator and the remaining powder was collected. The powder was annealed in a flowing Ar/H 2 (5% H 2 ) atmosphere at 900 °C for 2 h and then annealed in air at 250–550 °C (450 °C as the optimized temperature) for 3 h. After annealing, 50 mg of product was added to 20 ml of 1 M HCl and mixed at room temperature for 12 h to perform acid leaching, then centrifuged and washed with deionized water three times. Finally, the sample was dried at 80 °C in an oven for 12 h to obtain the Ni-RuO 2 catalyst. Ru a Ni b O x -AL samples with different amounts of Ni dopant were also prepared following the same procedure, except that the level of precursors was tuned in the first step. In addition, RuO 2 with no Ni incorporated was prepared in a similar method using RuCl 3 as precursor. M-RuO 2 (M=Fe, Co, Zn, Cu) samples with different metal dopants were also prepared using the same procedure, except that the precursors used in the first step were different—FeCl 3 , CoCl 2 , Zn(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O, and CuCl 2 ·2H 2 O. Of note, the weight ratio of total metal content in precursors to carbon black support was fixed at 1:4 in all catalyst synthesis.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalyst and its synthesis procedure from the given paragraph. Let me carefully analyze the text.

First, I need to identify the primary catalyst being synthesized - it's clearly Ni-RuO₂, a nickel-doped ruthenium oxide catalyst supported on carbon black. The paragraph describes a detailed procedure with specific quantities and conditions. 

Breaking down the synthesis steps: It starts with dissolving ruthenium chloride and nickel chloride hexahydrate in hydrochloric acid at a 3:1 molar ratio, followed by sonication. Then carbon black support is added with prolonged stirring. The drying method is rotary evaporation, then high-temperature annealing first in reducing atmosphere (Ar/H₂) then in oxidizing atmosphere (air). Important to note the acid leaching step after annealing, followed by washing and drying.

The user also mentions variations: different Ni dopant levels (RuₐNi_bO_x-AL), pure RuO₂ without Ni, and other metal-doped versions (Fe, Co, Zn, Cu). The consistent parameter is the 1:4 metal-to-carbon weight ratio.

As a professional chemist, I should highlight critical details: exact precursor masses, molar ratios, acid concentration, sonication/stirring durations, annealing temperatures and atmospheres, leaching conditions, and the fixed metal-to-support ratio. The user probably needs this for replication or research comparison, so precision matters.

I notice the paragraph contains some nuances like "optimized temperature" for the second annealing step and variations in precursors for different metals. Should clarify that while the core procedure remains consistent, precursor types differ for other dopants. The acid leaching is crucial for removing soluble species and activating the catalyst.

The user's request suggests they may be preparing catalysts themselves or evaluating this synthesis method. They likely need clear, actionable steps without ambiguity. I'll organize the information systematically while maintaining all technical specifications from the source text.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here's a professional summary of the catalyst synthesized and its detailed synthesis procedure:

**Catalyst Synthesized:**
*   **Primary Catalyst:** Ni-doped Ruthenium Oxide supported on Carbon Black, denoted **Ni-RuO₂**.
*   **Composition:** Ruthenium (Ru) and Nickel (Ni) oxides, with RuCl₃ and NiCl₂ used at a fixed **molar ratio of 3:1 (Ru:Ni)** in the precursor step. The final catalyst likely consists of RuO₂ crystallites doped/incorporated with Ni atoms.
*   **Support:** Carbon Black (Cabot, BP2000).
*   **Key Processing Step:** Acid Leaching (AL), indicated by the "-AL" suffix in related samples (RuₐNi_bO_x-AL).
*   **Metal Loading:** The **weight ratio of total metal (Ru + Ni) to carbon black support is fixed at 1:4** in all syntheses.

**Detailed Synthesis Procedure for Ni-RuO₂:**

1.  **Precursor Dissolution & Mixing:**
    *   Dissolve **0.1721 g of RuCl₃** and **0.0656 g of NiCl₂·6H₂O** (achieving a **Ru:Ni molar ratio of 3:1**) in **150 ml of 1 M HCl**.
    *   **Sonicate** the mixture for **2 hours** to ensure thorough mixing and dissolution.

2.  **Support Addition & Dispersion:**
    *   Add **0.4 g of Carbon Black (Cabot, BP2000)** to the solution.
    *   **Stir** the resulting slurry at **room temperature for 18 hours** to achieve a uniform distribution of the metal precursors on the carbon support.

3.  **Drying:**
    *   Remove the solvent using a **rotary evaporator**.
    *   Collect the resulting dried powder.

4.  **First Annealing (Reductive):**
    *   Anneal the powder in a **flowing Ar/H₂ atmosphere (5% H₂)**.
    *   Annealing **Temperature:** **900 °C**.
    *   Annealing **Time:** **2 hours**.
    *   *(Purpose: Likely reduces metal chlorides to metals/alloys and removes volatile impurities).*

5.  **Second Annealing (Oxidative):**
    *   Anneal the powder from step 4 in **flowing air**.
    *   Annealing **Temperature Range:** **250–550 °C** (**450 °C** identified as the optimized temperature).
    *   Annealing **Time:** **3 hours**.
    *   *(Purpose: Oxidizes the reduced metals to form the desired metal oxide phase, RuO₂ doped with Ni).*

6.  **Acid Leaching (AL):**
    *   Add **50 mg** of the annealed product from step 5 to **20 ml of 1 M HCl**.
    *   **Mix** the slurry at **room temperature for 12 hours**.
    *   *(Purpose: Removes soluble species, potentially unreacted precursors, weakly bound metals, or less stable phases, leaving behind the active doped oxide phase).*

7.  **Washing:**
    *   **Centrifuge** the leached mixture to separate the solid catalyst.
    *   **Wash** the solid pellet with **deionized water three times** (resuspending and centrifuging each time) to remove residual acid and soluble salts.

8.  **Final Drying:**
    *   Dry the washed solid in an **oven at 80 °C for 12 hours**.
    *   The final product is the **Ni-RuO₂ catalyst**.

**Variations Prepared (Using Same Core Procedure):**

1.  **RuₐNi_bO_x-AL:** Different Ni doping levels. Synthesized identically to Ni-RuO₂ **except** the amounts of RuCl₃ and NiCl₂·6H₂O precursors are adjusted in the first step to vary the Ru:Ni molar ratio (`a:b`). The *total metal (Ru+Ni) to carbon ratio (1:4)* and all subsequent steps remain identical.
2.  **Pure RuO₂:** Synthesized similarly **except** only RuCl₃ is used as the precursor in the first step (no Ni salt). The *Ru to carbon ratio (1:4)* and all subsequent steps remain identical.
3.  **M-RuO₂ (M = Fe, Co, Zn, Cu):** Different metal dopants (Iron, Cobalt, Zinc, Copper). Synthesized identically to Ni-RuO₂ **except** the metal precursor in the first step is replaced:
    *   **Fe:** Use FeCl₃ instead of NiCl₂·6H₂O (Ru:Fe molar ratio likely 3:1).
    *   **Co:** Use CoCl₂ instead of NiCl₂·6H₂O (Ru:Co molar ratio likely 3:1).
    *   **Zn:** Use Zn(NO₃)₂·6H₂O instead of NiCl₂·6H₂O (Ru:Zn molar ratio likely 3:1).
    *   **Cu:** Use CuCl₂·2H₂O instead of NiCl₂·6H₂O (Ru:Cu molar ratio likely 3:1).
    The *total metal (Ru + M) to carbon ratio (1:4)* and all subsequent steps remain identical.

**Critical Fixed Parameter:**
*   In **all** catalyst syntheses described (Ni-RuO₂, RuₐNi_bO_x-AL, Pure RuO₂, M-RuO₂), the **weight ratio of total metal content (from precursors) to carbon black support is fixed at 1:4**.
