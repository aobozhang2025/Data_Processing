question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Synthesis of electrocatalysts. In the first step, commercial ZIF-8 (Basolite Z1200, Sigma Aldrich) as a combined C and N precursor was pyrolysed in a tube furnace at 900 °C for 1 h under flowing nitrogen gas (research grade, BOC Ltd) to obtain a nitrogen-doped carbon framework that contained abundant Zn–N x sites (Zn–NC). A heating rate of 3 K min−1 was used to reach the set temperature of 900 °C. The Zn–NC product was then leached by refluxing in a 2 M H 2 SO 4 solution (95% H 2 SO 4 , Aristar, VWR) for 15–18 h to effectively remove most of the coordinated Zn (□-NC), although these sites are protonated. Leaching Zn–NC under aggressive acid reflux conditions was significantly more effective to remove Zn as compared with acid leaching at room temperature. In the second step, 100 mg of □-NC powder was dispersed in 100 ml of methanol (VWR) that contained 100 mg of Fe(II)Cl 2 ·4H 2 O (99%, Honeywell Fluka). This corresponded to an approximately 22 wt% Fe(II) content in the Fe and □-NC mixture. For the scaled-up synthesis, 700 mg of □-NC was dispersed in 250 ml of methanol that contained 700 mg of Fe(II)Cl 2 ·4H 2 O. This mixture was refluxed for 15–18 h with constant stirring followed by thorough washing in de-ionized water and then overnight leaching in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 to ensure a complete removal of the physisorbed Fe ions. Afterwards, this iron-coordinated catalyst was subjected to a thorough aqueous washing and was then dried in a vacuum oven overnight at 70 °C. This unactivated catalyst, Fe–NCU, was then mixed with the DCDA (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) in a weight ratio of 2:1 and thoroughly ground for 15 min before it was subjected to the activation step at 900 °C for 1 h under a flow of a 5% H 2 /N 2 gas mixture (BOC Ltd). The temperature ramping rate was 3 K min−1 and the sample was cooled down naturally to room temperature after activation to give final activated catalyst, Fe–NCΔ-DCDA. For single-cell PEMFC tests, □-NC was additionally ball-milled to prepare the Fe–NCΔ-DCDA catalyst. The ball-milling of the dried □-NC powder was carried out at 400 r.p.m. for 2 h prior to the Fe incorporation step by methanol reflux. A control sample, Fe-NCΔ, was prepared by heat treating the Fe–NC under identical conditions, except that no DCDA was added. The Fe–NCΔ-CA variant was obtained by using CA (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) instead of DCDA under otherwise identical activation conditions.



reasoning: 

Alright, let me tackle this query. The user wants a chemist's summary of catalyst synthesis from a technical paragraph. First, I need to identify the final catalyst: Fe–NCΔ-DCDA. The synthesis has multiple steps, so I'll break it down chronologically.

Starting with the precursor: ZIF-8 is pyrolyzed at 900°C under nitrogen to form Zn-NC. Acid leaching removes zinc, creating □-NC. Then iron is added via reflux with Fe(II)Cl₂·4H₂O in methanol, followed by acid washing. The key activation step involves mixing with DCDA and reheating at 900°C under H₂/N₂. 

I should note the control samples—Fe-NCΔ (no DCDA) and Fe–NCΔ-CA (using citric acid)—as they're important for comparison. The ball-milling step for PEMFC tests is also mentioned. 

The user likely needs this for replication or research purposes, so precision in parameters (temperatures, concentrations, durations) is crucial. They might be evaluating catalyst performance or comparing synthesis methods. Including all variants ensures they understand the experimental design. 

Need to verify each reagent and condition: pyrolysis at 900°C (3 K/min ramp), acid leaching in 2M H₂SO₄, Fe loading at 22 wt%, and DCDA ratio. Also, emphasize the removal of physisorbed Fe via 0.5M H₂SO₄ wash. 

Finally, structure the steps clearly: precursor prep, Zn removal, Fe coordination, activation. Highlighting the purpose of each step (e.g., acid reflux for Zn removal efficiency) adds context. Ensure no detail from the paragraph is missed, like the scaled-up synthesis quantities.
