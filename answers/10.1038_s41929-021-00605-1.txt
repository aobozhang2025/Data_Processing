question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Preparation of photocatalysts. Unless otherwise stated, the purities of all reagents for photocatalyst preparation and for photoelectrochemical measurements are above the analytical grade. The pristine PCN and PCN_Na15 were prepared according to the reported methods19. The Sb-SAPCs were prepared by a bottom-up method as follows: a certain amount of NaSbF 6 (HuNan HuaJing Powdery Material, 0.5 mmol, 1 mmol, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 mmol) was dissolved in 30 ml of ethanol under sonication for 60 min at 60 °C, followed by adding 4 g melamine (Wako Pure Chemical Industries). The solvent in the solution was removed by combination of rotatory evaporator and vacuum oven. The obtained white powder was transferred into a tube furnace. To ensure that oxygen was not present during thermal treatment, the tube furnace was first vacuumed to <1 torr before switching on the N 2 gas flow. This process was repeated three times, and then 50 ml min−1 N 2 gas flow was maintained for 30 min before heat treatment. During the synthesis process (including heating and cooling), the system was pressurized by N 2 flow so that oxygen could not influence the synthesis. The temperature of the furnace was increased from 25 °C to 560 °C at a ramp rate of 2 °C min−1 in N 2 atmosphere then kept at 560 °C for 4 h. After heat treatment, the furnace was cooled down naturally to 25 °C lasting for at least 8 h with continuous N 2 flowing.

reasoning: 

Alright, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalyst and its synthesis procedure from a given paragraph. Let me start by reading the paragraph carefully.

First, the catalyst mentioned is Sb-SAPCs. The acronym probably stands for Antimony-doped Single-Atom Photocatalysts. The synthesis involves NaSbF6 as the antimony source. The user might need this for research or application purposes, so clarity is key.

Looking at the reagents: NaSbF6 with varying amounts (0.5 to 20 mmol) and melamine (4g). Ethanol as solvent. The procedure starts with dissolving NaSbF6 in ethanol under sonication at 60°C for 60 minutes. Then melamine is added. The solvent removal uses a rotatory evaporator and vacuum oven, resulting in a white powder. 

Next, thermal treatment in a tube furnace. Important to note the inert atmosphere: vacuum and nitrogen purging repeated three times, then constant N2 flow. The heating ramp is slow: 2°C/min to 560°C, hold for 4 hours. Cooling is natural over 8 hours with N2 flow. 

I should mention the precursors' purity and the specific steps to exclude oxygen, as that affects the catalyst's properties. Also, the different NaSbF6 amounts suggest doping concentration studies. The user might be interested in reproducibility, so details like ramp rates and hold times are crucial. 

Need to structure the synthesis steps clearly, emphasizing the inert conditions and thermal profile. Highlighting the bottom-up method and the role of melamine as the carbon nitride source. Maybe the user is preparing similar catalysts and needs precise parameters to replicate the process. Ensuring all measurements and safety steps are covered, like the N2 flow during cooling. 

Also, note that pristine PCN and PCN_Na15 are prepared separately, but the focus here is on Sb-SAPCs. The user might need this summary for a report or to compare with other synthesis methods. Including the purification grades and sources of reagents adds credibility. 

Check if all critical details are covered: sonication time, temperature, solvent volume, drying method, furnace atmosphere control, heating/cooling rates, durations. Mentioning the natural cooling time is important for crystal formation. 

Avoiding jargon but maintaining technical terms like "rotatory evaporator" and "ramp rate" since the user is a chemist. Confirming that Sb-SAPCs are the main catalyst synthesized here. Maybe the user wants to know why certain steps are taken, like repeated vacuum-N2 cycles, to ensure oxygen-free environment. 

Summarizing concisely but thoroughly, ensuring each step is logically ordered. The user's deeper need might be understanding the synthesis for replication or modification, so accuracy in parameters is vital. Also, highlighting the variables (NaSbF6 amounts) for optimization studies.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here is a professional chemist's summary of the synthesized catalyst and its detailed synthesis procedure:

**Synthesized Catalyst:**
*   **Name:** Antimony-doped Single-Atom Polymeric Carbon Nitride Photocatalyst (Sb-SAPCs).
*   **Base Material:** Polymeric Carbon Nitride (PCN), modified with antimony (Sb).
*   **Dopant Source:** Sodium Hexafluoroantimonate (NaSbF₆).
*   **Key Feature:** Antimony (Sb) atoms are incorporated into the PCN structure at single-atom sites (inferred from "SAPCs").
*   **Form:** Solid powder.

**Synthesis Procedure (Bottom-up method):**

1.  **Precursor Solution Preparation:**
    *   Dissolve a specific amount of **NaSbF₆** (0.5 mmol, 1 mmol, 3 mmol, 5 mmol, 10 mmol, 15 mmol, or 20 mmol) in **30 ml of absolute ethanol**.
    *   **Sonicate** this solution for **60 minutes** at **60 °C**.
    *   Add **4.0 grams of melamine** (C₃H₆N₆) to the sonicated solution.

2.  **Solvent Removal & Precursor Isolation:**
    *   Remove the ethanol solvent from the mixture using a combination of:
        *   **Rotatory evaporator** (for bulk solvent removal).
        *   **Vacuum oven** (for complete drying).
    *   This yields a **dry white powder** (intimate mixture of melamine and NaSbF₆).

3.  **Inert Atmosphere Setup (Tube Furnace):**
    *   Transfer the dry white powder into a **tube furnace**.
    *   Rigorously exclude oxygen:
        *   Evacuate the furnace tube to a pressure **< 1 Torr**.
        *   Backfill with high-purity **Nitrogen (N₂) gas**.
        *   Repeat this **evacuation/N₂ purge cycle three times**.
        *   Finally, establish a continuous **N₂ flow of 50 ml min⁻¹** and maintain it for **30 minutes** *before* starting heating.

4.  **Thermal Polycondensation (Carbon Nitride Formation & Sb Doping):**
    *   Heat the sample under **continuous N₂ flow (50 ml min⁻¹)**.
    *   **Ramp Rate:** Heat from room temperature (**25 °C**) to the target temperature (**560 °C**) at a rate of **2 °C min⁻¹**.
    *   **Hold Time:** Maintain the temperature at **560 °C** for **4 hours**.
    *   **Atmosphere Control:** Maintain positive **N₂ pressure** throughout heating and subsequent cooling to prevent oxygen ingress.

5.  **Controlled Cooling:**
    *   After the 4-hour hold, turn off the furnace heat.
    *   Allow the furnace to **cool naturally back to room temperature (25 °C)**. This cooling process must take **at least 8 hours**.
    *   Maintain the **continuous N₂ flow (50 ml min⁻¹)** throughout the entire cooling period.

6.  **Product Collection:**
    *   Once cooled to room temperature, the resulting **Sb-SAPC catalyst** is removed from the furnace as a solid powder.

**Critical Synthesis Details:**

*   **Reagent Purity:** All reagents are **analytical grade or higher**.
*   **Dopant Variation:** The amount of Sb dopant is systematically varied by changing the initial amount of NaSbF₆ (0.5 - 20 mmol).
*   **Oxygen Exclusion:** Paramount importance is placed on creating and maintaining an **oxygen-free N₂ atmosphere** throughout thermal treatment (evacuation/purge cycles, continuous flow, positive pressure).
*   **Thermal Profile:** Characterized by a **slow ramp rate (2 °C/min)**, a **specific hold temperature (560 °C)**, a **long hold time (4 h)**, and **very slow natural cooling (≥8 h)**. This is crucial for forming the correct PCN structure and incorporating Sb.
*   **Precursor Mixing:** Ensured by **sonication in ethanol** and **coprecipitation/drying**.
*   **Base PCN Control:** The pristine PCN and PCN_Na15 used for comparison were prepared separately using literature methods.

This procedure describes the synthesis of Sb-doped polymeric carbon nitride photocatalysts with controlled single-atom Sb sites, achieved through careful precursor mixing, solvent removal, and strictly controlled thermal polycondensation under an inert atmosphere.
