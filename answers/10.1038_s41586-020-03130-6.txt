question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Synthesis of Pt/α-MoC catalysts. Pt was deposited onto α-MoC (100 m 2 g −1 ) using an incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) method. Before the loading of Pt precursor, the α-MoC substrate was reduced in 10% H 2 /nitrogen (N 2 ) (20 ml min −1 ) at 523 K for 60 min, which is expected to create more surface anchoring sites for Pt species compared with our previous reported method 19 . Appropriate amounts of H 2 PtCl 6 ·6H 2 O (Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in 200 μl deaerated deionized water. The Pt precursor solution was finely mixed with 50 mg α-MoC powder, followed by drying in a vacuum oven at 323 K. Before catalytic evalu- ation, the samples were mildly reduced at 623 K for 1 h under H 2 flow at a flow rate of 60 ml min −1 first. Then the stream was switched to 15% CH 4 /H 2 (100 ml min −1 ), and the temperature was increased at 5 K min −1 to 863 K and then held at this temperature for 2 h to reactivate the samples. The samples were then cooled to room temperature in 15% CH 4 /H 2 .

Synthesis of α-MoC. Ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate (AMT, (NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 ·4H 2 O) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Rea- gent. The grinded powder of AMT was calcined in the muffle oven to 773 K at a rate of 10 K min −1 to synthesize the precursor MoO 3 . Typi- cally, 1 g MoO 3 was loaded into the tubular quartz reactor and placed in a vertical furnace. The powder was heated to 973 K in ammonia (160 ml min −1 ; pre-purified gas) at a rate of 5 K min −1 and kept at 973 K for 2 h. After the sample was cooled to room temperature, the gas was switched to a methane (CH 4 )/H 2 mixture (150 ml min −1 ; 20/80 v/v) and the temperature was increased to 973 K at 5 K min −1 and held at 973 K for 2 h. Finally, the sample was passivated at room temperature using a 1% oxygen/Ar gas mixture.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to summarize the synthesis of a Pt/α-MoC catalyst from a technical paragraph. Let me break this down carefully. 

Hmm, the user seems to be either a chemistry student or a researcher needing a clear procedural breakdown. They specifically asked for "all details", so precision is crucial. The paragraph contains two synthesis procedures - first for α-MoC support, then for Pt deposition on it. 

For α-MoC synthesis: Starting with ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate (AMT)... it's ground and calcined to MoO3 at 773K. Then comes the tricky nitridation-carburization two-step: ammonia flow at 973K for nitridation, followed by CH4/H2 mixture at same temperature for carburization. Important detail - they passivate it with 1% O2/Ar at the end. Surface area is given as 100 m²/g, which matters for catalyst performance.

Now Pt deposition... Interesting they modified the pretreatment. Reducing α-MoC in 10% H2/N2 at 523K before impregnation - the text explicitly says this creates more anchoring sites than their previous method. Using incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) with H2PtCl6·6H2O dissolved in degassed water. Exact amounts: 200μl water for 50mg support. Drying at 323K in vacuum oven seems standard. 

The activation protocol is quite specific: first mild H2 reduction at 623K, then switch to 15% CH4/H2 while ramping to 863K for "reactivation". That 2-hour hold at high temperature in methane-rich atmosphere probably forms the active phase. 

Better highlight the novelty - that prereduction step for the support is presented as an improvement over their prior work. Should emphasize flow rates too since mass transfer affects these processes. 

User didn't ask for analysis, but as a catalysis specialist I should note that this CH4/H2 activation likely creates carbide-supported Pt clusters - the methane probably maintains carbide stoichiometry while reducing Pt. But since they just want facts, I'll stick to procedural summary. 

Must double-check all parameters: temperatures, gas compositions, flow rates, hold times. No room for error when someone's replicating this. Especially that critical transition from H2 reduction to CH4/H2 atmosphere during activation.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here is a detailed summary of the synthesized catalyst and its synthesis procedure:

**Synthesized Catalyst:** Platinum supported on alpha-Molybdenum Carbide (**Pt/α-MoC**).

**Synthesis Procedure:**

The synthesis involves two distinct steps: **1) Synthesis of the α-MoC support** and **2) Deposition of Pt onto α-MoC**.

**1. Synthesis of α-MoC Support:**
    *   **Precursor:** Ammonium Molybdate Tetrahydrate (AMT, (NH₄)₆Mo₇O₂₄·4H₂O).
    *   **Step 1: Calcination to MoO₃**
        *   AMT powder is ground.
        *   The ground powder is calcined in a muffle furnace.
        *   Heating rate: 10 K min⁻¹.
        *   Final temperature: 773 K.
        *   Held at 773 K: Not explicitly stated (presumably just to reach temperature).
    *   **Step 2: Nitridation in Ammonia (NH₃)**
        *   1 g of the resulting MoO₃ powder is loaded into a tubular quartz reactor in a vertical furnace.
        *   Gas: Ammonia (pre-purified), flow rate: 160 ml min⁻¹.

        *   Solvent: 200 μl of deaerated, deionized water.
        *   An appropriate amount of H₂PtCl₆·6H₂O is dissolved in the water to achieve the desired Pt loading (loading not specified in text).
        *   The Pt precursor solution is finely mixed with 50 mg of the pretreated α-MoC powder.

        *   **Cooling:**
            *   Cooled to room temperature under the 15% CH₄/H₂ flow.

**Key Catalyst Features:** The final catalyst consists of Platinum nanoparticles deposited onto a pretreated alpha-Molybdenum Carbide support, activated under specific reducing/carburizing conditions. The pretreatment of the α-MoC support before Pt impregnation is highlighted as a key modification to enhance Pt anchoring.
