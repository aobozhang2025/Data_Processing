question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Synthesis of Pt/α-MoC catalysts. Pt was deposited onto α-MoC (100 m 2 g −1 ) using an incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) method. Before the loading of Pt precursor, the α-MoC substrate was reduced in 10% H 2 /nitrogen (N 2 ) (20 ml min −1 ) at 523 K for 60 min, which is expected to create more surface anchoring sites for Pt species compared with our previous reported method 19 . Appropriate amounts of H 2 PtCl 6 ·6H 2 O (Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in 200 μl deaerated deionized water. The Pt precursor solution was finely mixed with 50 mg α-MoC powder, followed by drying in a vacuum oven at 323 K. Before catalytic evalu- ation, the samples were mildly reduced at 623 K for 1 h under H 2 flow at a flow rate of 60 ml min −1 first. Then the stream was switched to 15% CH 4 /H 2 (100 ml min −1 ), and the temperature was increased at 5 K min −1 to 863 K and then held at this temperature for 2 h to reactivate the samples. The samples were then cooled to room temperature in 15% CH 4 /H 2 .

Synthesis of α-MoC. Ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate (AMT, (NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 ·4H 2 O) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Rea- gent. The grinded powder of AMT was calcined in the muffle oven to 773 K at a rate of 10 K min −1 to synthesize the precursor MoO 3 . Typi- cally, 1 g MoO 3 was loaded into the tubular quartz reactor and placed in a vertical furnace. The powder was heated to 973 K in ammonia (160 ml min −1 ; pre-purified gas) at a rate of 5 K min −1 and kept at 973 K for 2 h. After the sample was cooled to room temperature, the gas was switched to a methane (CH 4 )/H 2 mixture (150 ml min −1 ; 20/80 v/v) and the temperature was increased to 973 K at 5 K min −1 and held at 973 K for 2 h. Finally, the sample was passivated at room temperature using a 1% oxygen/Ar gas mixture.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalysts and procedures from a technical paragraph. Let me analyze this carefully.

Hmm, the text describes two distinct catalysts: Pt/α-MoC and the α-MoC support itself. For Pt/α-MoC, I notice the key steps involve substrate pretreatment, precise impregnation, and a multi-stage activation. The α-MoC synthesis is equally complex with ammonolysis and carburization phases. 

The user seems to need a clear, structured breakdown - probably for replication purposes. They might be a researcher or student working on heterogeneous catalysts. I should emphasize critical details like gas compositions, temperature ramps, and the rationale behind each step (like why they reduced α-MoC before Pt loading to create anchoring sites).

Ah, the activation procedure for Pt/α-MoC is particularly intricate - mild reduction followed by CH₄/H₂ treatment. That's likely to form active sites while preventing sintering. I should explain how each step contributes to the final catalyst structure. 

For α-MoC synthesis, the ammonolysis step at 973K is crucial for creating Mo₂N intermediate before carburization. The passivation at end is easily overlooked but vital for safety. Must highlight that.

Better organize this chronologically for both materials. The quantities (50mg substrate, 200μl solution) suggest lab-scale synthesis - good to note. Also should mention all precursors and suppliers since reproducibility matters in catalysis.

The CH₄/H₂ reactivation step is unusual - probably specific to this catalyst system. I'll emphasize its purpose. User might appreciate knowing this differs from conventional Pt catalysts.

...*checking temperatures*... Wait, the final reactivation at 863K is higher than reduction step. That thermal treatment likely restructures the surface. Must connect these processing conditions to probable catalyst behavior.

Should I mention characterization? The text doesn't include any, so probably not. Focus strictly on synthesis as requested. 

User didn't ask for applications, but the CH₄ involvement hints at methane-related reactions. Still, I'll stick to synthesis unless they ask further.

**Key Synthesis Rationale Highlights:**
*   The α-MoC pretreatment (H₂ reduction at 523 K) is explicitly done to enhance Pt anchoring.
*   The Pt/α-MoC activation involves a critical two-step process: 1) Standard reduction in H₂ to form metallic Pt, followed by 2) A high-temperature treatment in CH₄/H₂. This CH₄/H₂ step likely serves to "reactivate" the carbide surface or modify the Pt-carbide interface after the initial reduction, potentially removing surface oxygen or restructuring the surface.
*   The α-MoC synthesis requires a nitridation step (ammonolysis) to form a molybdenum nitride (Mo₂N) intermediate before the final carburization step. Passivation is essential for safe handling of the pyrophoric carbide powder.
