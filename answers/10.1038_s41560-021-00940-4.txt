question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Materials. All chemicals with analytical-grade purity were purchased and used directly without further treatment unless otherwise noted. All solutions were prepared with ultrapure water. Commercial Pd/C (10 wt%, 8 nm Pd particles on activated carbon, Aldrich) and Pt/C (20 wt%, 3 nm Pt particles on carbon black, Johnson Matthey) were used as baseline catalysts. Nafion solution (5.0 wt%), carbon paper (TGP-H-060) and anion-exchange membranes (Fumasep FAS-PET-75) were purchased from the Fuel Cell Store. Vulcan XC-72 carbon black (Fuel Cell Earth) was used as the catalyst support.

Synthesis of heteroatom X-doped carbon (X–C, X = N, P, S, B, F). First, 0.2 g O–C and 1.0 g melamine (C 3 H 6 N 6 ) were ground together in an agate mortar for 1 h and then pyrolysed at 900 °C for 2 h in an argon atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, N–C was obtained by washing with ethanol and water. The same method was used to synthesize P–C, S–C, B–C and F–C with sodium hypophosphite anhydrous (NaH 2 PO 2 , 98%), sulfur powder (99.5%), boracic acid (H 3 BO 3 , 99.5%) and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF, 99%) as P, S, B and F sources, respectively. Note that the temperature for the synthesis of B–C was 1,000 °C (ref. 44).

Synthesis of heteroatom X–F-codoped carbon (X&F–C, X = N, P, S, B). First, 0.1 g N–C and 0.8 g PVDF were ground together in an agate mortar for 1 h and then added into a solution consisting of 30 ml acetone and 10 ml H 2 O. After sonication for 0.5 h, the mixture was refluxed at 120 °C in an oil bath until fully dried. The mixture was further pyrolysed at 600 °C for 2 h in an argon atmosphere.

reasoning: 

Okay, let me tackle this query as a catalyst synthesis specialist. The user wants me to extract and summarize catalyst synthesis details from a technical paragraph. 

First, I notice the text describes two main synthesis routes: heteroatom-doped carbons (X-C) and codoped carbons (X&F-C). The key catalysts being synthesized are nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, boron, and fluorine-doped carbon supports, plus their fluorine-codoped counterparts.

For X-C synthesis: 
- Base material is O-C (likely oxygen-functionalized carbon)
- Dopant sources vary: melamine for N, sodium hypophosphite for P, sulfur powder for S, boric acid for B, PVDF for F
- Procedure involves solid-state grinding in agate mortar (1h) followed by pyrolysis
- Pyrolysis conditions: 900°C/2h/Ar for most, but 1000°C for B-C
- Post-treatment: washing with ethanol/water

For X&F-C:
- Uses pre-made X-C (0.1g) with PVDF (0.8g) as F source
- Novel step: dispersion in acetone-water (30:10 ml) with sonication (0.5h)
- Drying via reflux at 120°C in oil bath
- Lower pyrolysis temp: 600°C/2h/Ar

I should highlight the material specifications too - they use Vulcan XC-72 carbon black as support, and reference commercial Pd/C and Pt/C catalysts. The user seems to need precise procedural details, so I'll organize this systematically while maintaining all critical parameters like temperatures, durations, and precursor ratios.

The mention of ref. 44 for B-C synthesis suggests this might be for academic use, so accuracy in reporting the exception (1000°C for boron) is crucial. I'll present this as two clear synthesis pathways with comparative elements.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here's a precise summary of the catalysts synthesized and their detailed procedures, as a professional catalyst chemist:

**Catalysts Synthesized:**
1.  **Single Heteroatom-Doped Carbon Catalysts (X–C):** N-doped carbon (N–C), P-doped carbon (P–C), S-doped carbon (S–C), B-doped carbon (B–C), F-doped carbon (F–C).
2.  **Heteroatom-Fluorine Co-doped Carbon Catalysts (X&F–C):** N&F-codoped carbon (N&F–C), P&F-codoped carbon (P&F–C), S&F-codoped carbon (S&F–C), B&F-codoped carbon (B&F–C).

**Detailed Synthesis Procedures:**

**1. Synthesis of Single Heteroatom-Doped Carbon (X–C; X = N, P, S, B, F):**
    *   **Precursor:** 0.2 g O-doped carbon (O–C).
    *   **Dopant Sources:**
        *   N–C: 1.0 g Melamine (C₃H₆N₆)
        *   P–C: 1.0 g Sodium hypophosphite anhydrous (NaH₂PO₂, 98%)
        *   S–C: 1.0 g Sulfur powder (99.5%)
        *   B–C: 1.0 g Boric acid (H₃BO₃, 99.5%)
        *   F–C: 1.0 g Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF, 99%)
    *   **Mixing:** O–C and the dopant source are ground together in an agate mortar for 1 hour.
    *   **Pyrolysis:**
        *   **Atmosphere:** Argon (Ar).
        *   **Temperature & Time:** 900 °C for 2 hours *(Exception: B–C synthesized at 1000 °C for 2 hours, Ref. 44)*.
    *   **Post-treatment:** After cooling to room temperature, the pyrolyzed material is washed with ethanol and water to obtain the final X–C catalyst.

**2. Synthesis of Heteroatom-Fluorine Co-doped Carbon (X&F–C; X = N, P, S, B):**
    *   **Precursors:**
        *   0.1 g Pre-synthesized single heteroatom-doped carbon (X–C; e.g., N–C for N&F–C).
        *   0.8 g Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF, 99%) - Fluorine source.
    *   **Mixing:** X–C and PVDF are ground together in an agate mortar for 1 hour.
    *   **Dispersion:** The ground mixture is added to a solution of 30 ml acetone and 10 ml ultrapure water (H₂O).
    *   **Sonication:** The mixture is sonicated for 0.5 hours.
    *   **Drying:** The sonicated mixture is refluxed at 120 °C in an oil bath until fully dried.
    *   **Pyrolysis:**
        *   **Atmosphere:** Argon (Ar).
        *   **Temperature & Time:** 600 °C for 2 hours.
    *   **Post-treatment:** The resulting material is the final X&F–C catalyst (no washing mentioned post-pyrolysis for these codoped materials).

**Key Material Notes:**
*   The base carbon support used for initial doping is implied to be **Vulcan XC-72 carbon black** (listed under Materials).
*   **O–C** (Oxygen-doped carbon) is the starting material for all single heteroatom-doped carbons (X–C). Its synthesis isn't described here but is assumed to be pre-existing.
*   The **X–C** materials synthesized in the first procedure are used as precursors for the corresponding **X&F–C** materials in the second procedure.
*   All procedures use an inert Ar atmosphere during pyrolysis to prevent oxidation.
