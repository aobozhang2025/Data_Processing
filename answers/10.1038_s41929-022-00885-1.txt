question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Catalyst preparation The method of synthesizing M 1 –N–C catalysts was based on the previ- ous work 29,42 . Given that higher temperature is conducive to the forma- tion of a more stable catalyst, which is required in the PDH reaction, we selected the high pyrolysis temperature of 900 °C to prepare the Ru 1 /NC catalyst. C 2 H 4 N 4 (12 g), C 3 H 7 NO 2 (3 g) and Ru(acac) 3 (40 mg) were added together to a ball mill jar. The mixture was then ground at a speed of 400 rpm for 2 h. The resulting powder was transferred to a tubular furnace under N 2 atmosphere (flow rate = 60 ml min –1 ) via the following treatment: The temperature was increased from 25 to 600 °C (3 °C min –1 ) and maintained at 600 °C for 2 h; and then it was further increased from 600 to 900 °C (2 °C min –1 ) and maintained at 900 °C for 1 h. The prepared catalyst was named Ru 1 /NC. NC support was prepared via the same method without the addition of Ru(acac) 3 . Ru 1 /NC-700 was prepared by the same method except the final calcination temperature was 700 °C. The content of N species can be controlled by modulating the ratio of C 3 H 7 NO 2 to C 2 H 4 N 4 that acted as N resources. The Ru 1 /NC-2 catalyst was obtained using 11.5 g C 2 H 4 N 4 and 3.5 g C 3 H 7 NO 2 , whereas Ru 1 /NC-3 was obtained using 11 g C 2 H 4 N 4 and 4 g C 3 H 7 NO 2 , with the other preparation parameters the same as that for Ru 1 /NC. The N to Ru mass ratios on these Ru 1 /NC catalysts were determined by XPS characteriza- tion. For comparison, the Ru loading in NC support catalysts with the Ru content of 1.3 wt% and 6.0 wt%, denoted as 1RuNP/NC and 6RuNP/ NC, respectively, were prepared using the impregnation method. The commercial PtSn/Al 2 O 3 (0.5 wt% Pt, 1.5 wt% Sn, 0.8 wt% K) catalyst was obtained from Universal Oil Product company.

Results Ru single atoms surrounded by N species on NC support The synthetic process of Ru single atoms anchored on N-doped carbon (NC), denoted as Ru 1 /NC, is shown in Fig. 1a. A mixture of ruthenium acetylacetonate (Ru(acac) 3 ), l-alanine (C 3 H 7 NO 2 ) and dicyandiamide (C 2 H 4 N 4 ) was ground evenly using the ball-milling method, followed by pyrolysis under N 2 atmosphere at 900 °C for 1 h. The Ru content over Ru 1 /NC is 1.2 wt%, based on inductively coupled plasma atomic emis- sion spectroscopy. For comparison, catalysts with an Ru loading of 1.3 and 6.0 wt% on NC, denoted as 1RuNP/NC and 6RuNP/NC, respectively, were synthesized using the impregnation method. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images of Ru 1 /NC at different image magnifications (Fig. 1b and Sup- plementary Fig. 1) do not show any Ru nanoparticles. Furthermore, aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM (AC-HAADF-STEM) reveals that a large number of uniformly dispersed Ru single atoms are clearly observed over Ru 1 /NC (Fig. 1c,d). Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) was conducted to characterize the local element distribution and coordination around Ru single atoms. As displayed in Fig. 1e, both Ru/C (the EELS spectra of Ru and C are overlapped) and N spectra are detected when the electron beam is focused on an individual Ru single atom, demonstrating Ru 1 is bonded to N/C rather than O, which is con- sistent with the previously reported M–N–C catalysts 31,32 . The elemental mapping images (Fig. 1f) of Ru 1 /NC by energy-dispersive X-ray spec- troscopy show that Ru, N and C are homogeneously dispersed. For comparison, Ru nanoparticles can be discerned clearly over 1RuNP/ NC and 6RuNP/NC by HAADF-STEM (Supplementary Figs. 2a and 3a). Statistical analysis for approximately 200 particles shows that the average particle sizes of Ru metal over 1RuNP/NC and 6RuNP/NC are

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalyst and its preparation from the given paragraph. Let me carefully extract all the relevant details.

First, I need to identify the main catalyst being discussed - it's Ru₁/NC, which stands for ruthenium single atoms on nitrogen-doped carbon support. The key synthesis elements involve three components: ruthenium acetylacetonate (Ru(acac)₃) as the metal precursor, dicyandiamide (C₂H₄N₄) and L-alanine (C₃H₇NO₂) as nitrogen/carbon sources.

The synthesis procedure has several critical steps: 
Pre-mixing via ball milling - 12g dicyandiamide + 3g L-alanine + 40mg Ru(acac)₃ ground at 400 rpm for 2 hours. Then pyrolysis under nitrogen atmosphere with specific temperature programming: ramp from 25°C to 600°C at 3°C/min, hold 2 hours; then ramp to 900°C at 2°C/min, hold 1 hour. The N₂ flow rate is 60 ml/min.

I notice several catalyst variations mentioned: 
Ru₁/NC-700 (same as above but final temp 700°C)
Ru₁/NC-2 (11.5g dicyandiamide + 3.5g L-alanine)
Ru₁/NC-3 (11g dicyandiamide + 4g L-alanine)
Also NC support control (without Ru precursor)
And nanoparticle controls 1RuNP/NC and 6RuNP/NC made by impregnation

The characterization confirms successful synthesis of single-atom catalysts: 
1.2 wt% Ru loading
HAADF-STEM shows no nanoparticles, only single atoms
EELS shows Ru bonded to N/C (not O)
Elemental mapping shows homogeneous distribution

The user seems to need this for academic or industrial research purposes, probably to replicate or build upon this synthesis. They're likely a chemist or materials scientist working on catalyst development. The detailed procedural parameters suggest they value precision in replication. I should emphasize the temperature control and atmosphere conditions as critical factors for successful synthesis.
