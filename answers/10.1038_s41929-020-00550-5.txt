question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Synthesis of Co-TiO 2 , Ni-TiO 2 , Fe-TiO 2 , Cu-TiO 2 , Mn-TiO 2 and TiO 2 nanorods. The TiO 2 and Co-TiO 2 nanorods were synthesized by an organic colloidal solution approach based on our previous publication33. As TiCl 4 is highly sensitive to moisture, all the solvents employed in the synthesis were pre-dried at 90 °C in a vacuum using a typical Schlenk link technique. For the synthesis of the TiO 2 nanorods, a Ti precursor solution containing 0.2 M TiCl 4 and 1.0 M OAc was first prepared by dissolving TiCl 4 (2.19 ml) and OAc (31.59 ml) in ODE (66.25 ml) and stored in a N 2 -filled glove box. In a four-necked reactor, ODE (10 ml), OAm (10 ml) and OAc (0.48 ml) were heated under vacuum at 90 °C for 1 hour to remove dissolved moisture and oxygen, and subsequently cooled to 60 °C under N 2 . Next, 1.5 ml of Ti precursor solution was injected into the system, which was then quickly heated to 290 °C and maintained at that temperature for 10 min. Next, 8 ml of additional Ti precursor solution was added into the reactor at a rate of 0.3 ml min−1. After cooling to room temperature, the TiO 2 nanorods were collected, washed with isopropanol and centrifuged at 8,000 r.p.m. for 8 min. The product was further purified twice by the addition of hexanes and isopropanol. The Co-TiO 2 nanorods were synthesized by a similar route. A Co oleate solution containing 0.2 M cobalt oleate and 1.0 M OAc was mixed with the Ti precursor solution with the desired Ti/Co ratio. Next, 1.5 ml of this solution was injected into a degassed solution containing 10 ml of ODE, 10 ml of OAm and 0.48 ml of OAc at 60 °C, and the mixture was quickly heated to 290 °C. After being held at that temperature for 10 min, another 8 ml of the mixed Ti/Co precursor solution was introduced into the system at 0.3 ml min−1. The as-prepared Co-TiO 2 nanorods were collected and purified in the same way as for the TiO 2 nanorods. In this synthesis, the Co doping level was tuned by altering the Ti/Co ratio in the mixed precursor solution. Specifically, with Ti/Co molar ratios of 8:1, 8:2 and 8:3, Co doping levels of 4.2, 7.5 and 12% were achieved in the Co-TiO 2 nanorods. The Ni-TiO 2 , Fe-TiO 2 , Cu-TiO 2 and Mn-TiO 2 nanorods were synthesized by the same approach, using the corresponding metal oleate to substitute for Co oleate33. The synthesis of CoO nanoparticles is described in the Supplementary Methods.


reasoning: 

Alright, let me approach this query as a synthetic chemist specializing in catalyst design. The user wants a distilled summary of catalyst synthesis from a technical paragraph, so I'll focus on extracting key details while maintaining accuracy. 

First, I notice the core materials are TiO₂ nanorods and transition metal-doped variants (Co, Ni, Fe, Cu, Mn). The organic colloidal method described requires meticulous moisture control - evident from the Schlenk line prep and glove box usage. That's crucial for handling TiCl₄'s reactivity.

Hmm, the synthesis has two parallel paths: undoped TiO₂ and doped versions. For TiO₂, the precursor prep involves dissolving TiCl₄ and oleic acid (OAc) in 1-octadecene (ODE). The reaction phase is interesting - initial injection of small precursor volume (1.5ml) at 290°C likely seeds nucleation, followed by slow addition (0.3ml/min) for controlled growth. Smart design.

For doped catalysts like Co-TiO₂, they premix Co-oleate with Ti-precursor. The doping level control via Ti/Co ratios (8:1 to 8:3 yielding 4.2-12% Co) is particularly useful for catalyst optimization studies. Other metals follow identical protocols with their oleates.

The purification is standard but critical: isopropanol washes followed by hexane/IPA solvent pairs. I should emphasize how this removes organics without damaging nanorods. 

Wait - the user mentioned being a chemistry professional, so I'll skip defining basic terms like Schlenk line but ensure all acronyms (OAm, ODE) are spelled out. They probably want procedural clarity for replication, so I'll sequence steps chronologically and highlight air-sensitive handling.

Notable exclusion: CoO nanoparticle synthesis is referenced but not detailed here. Should explicitly state it's in Supplementary Methods to avoid confusion. 

For the response structure, I'll categorize by catalyst type first, then break down shared vs. unique steps. The metal doping percentages deserve a dedicated line since they're key performance variables. Might add a footnote about oleate's dual role as stabilizer and carboxylate source.
