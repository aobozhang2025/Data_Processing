question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Catalyst synthesis The Ru-CuNW catalyst was synthesized on the basis of our previ- ously published method 47 with slight modification. In brief, a 2 cm 2 Cu foam was washed with isopropyl alcohol, 0.1 M HCl, and then soaked in 0.1 M (NH 4 ) 2 S 2 O 8 with 1 M NaOH under ambient conditions for 1 h. The synthesized Cu(OH) 2 was then washed with deionized water and soaked in 10 mM RuCl 3 solution under ambient conditions overnight. Next, the product was dried at 70 °C in an oven for 1 h and then annealed in a flowing Ar atmosphere at 200 °C for 2 h. Finally, an in situ electrochemical pre-reduction step was performed, which was operated by the CP method at 100 mA cm −2 overnight, followed by 200 mA cm −2 for 1 h to obtain the final Ru-CuNW catalyst. This catalyst was directly used as the cathode electrode for later electrochemical measurements.

reasoning: 

Alright, the user wants me to summarize the catalyst synthesis from a chemistry paper. They're asking me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis. Let me break down the paragraph step by step.

First, the catalyst is called Ru-CuNW. The synthesis builds on a previous method with modifications. The base material is a 2 cm² copper foam. The cleaning process involves washing with isopropyl alcohol and 0.1 M HCl, followed by soaking in a solution of 0.1 M ammonium persulfate and 1 M NaOH for an hour. This step converts the copper surface to copper hydroxide nanowires. 

After that, they wash the Cu(OH)₂ with deionized water and soak it in 10 mM ruthenium trichloride overnight. This likely deposits ruthenium species onto the nanowires. Then they dry it at 70°C for an hour and anneal in argon at 200°C for two hours. The annealing probably helps form the metallic Ru-Cu structure.

The final step is electrochemical pre-reduction. They use constant current: 100 mA/cm² overnight and then 200 mA/cm² for an hour. This reduces the catalyst to its active form. The resulting Ru-CuNW catalyst is used directly as the cathode.

I should highlight each step clearly, mention the purposes like cleaning, oxidation, Ru deposition, annealing, and electrochemical reduction. Also, note the concentrations, temperatures, and times. The user might need this for replicating the experiment or understanding the catalyst's preparation for their research. They might be a chemist or a student looking for detailed synthesis procedures. Ensuring clarity and completeness is key here.
