question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods The synthesis of Pt 1 /OLC. Two main synthesis processes were involved in the preparation of the catalyst: a thermal annealing method was used to prepare the OLC and tune the density of the oxygen species and an ALD technique was used to deposit Pt precursors on the OLC supports. Typically, pristine DND powder (Henan Union Abrasive Co. Ltd) was first oxidized to remove the amorphous carbon and graft the oxygen functional groups outside the surface. The pristine DND powder (1 g) was added to a 100 ml mixture of H 2 SO 4 and HNO 3 (3:1 volume ratio) and refluxed at 160 °C for 24 h (ref. 37). When cooled down, the oxidized DND was washed with deionized water several times until a pH value of 7 was

The synthesis of Pt 1 /graphene. Graphene oxide was prepared by the improved method according to the previous report38. In brief, a mixture of 120 ml of concentrated H 2 SO 4 and 14 ml of H 3 PO 4 was added to graphite flakes (1.0 g), then the temperature was held at around 35–40 °C and 6 g of KMnO 4 was slowly added to it. The reaction was carried out at 50 °C and stirred for 12 h. When cooled down, ice along with several drops of 30 wt% H 2 O 2 were poured in until the solution turned yellow. The precipitates were filtered out and washed using 300 ml of 5 wt% HCl three times, followed by deionized water several times until a pH value of 7 was attained. The final products were freeze-dried. The as-prepared graphene oxide nanosheets were annealed at 1,050 °C for 10 min under an Ar atmosphere and served as a loading support to the anchored Pt atoms. We carried out a one- cycle ALD procedure using the same timing sequence as that for Pt 1 /OLC.

Synthesis of Pt single atoms on curved carbon supports To realize this ingenious catalyst design (Fig. 1a), to engineer vacancy defects and functional groups on the OLC supports is a critical step to stabilize isolated metal atoms7,9,18,19. In our experi- ments, surface-oxidized detonation nanodiamonds (DNDs) were selected as the starting material to obtain OLC due to their near uniform small-size distribution. This material was treated via ther- mal deoxygenation at various temperatures to tune precisely the type and distribution density of oxygen species, and the DND was automatically transformed into an OLC at elevated temperatures (>900 °C) (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2)20. Then, a single cycle atomic layer deposition (ALD) was used to produce isolated Pt atoms on all the supports. To identify the form of the Pt atoms distributed on OLC sup- ports, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) was used. It is shown in Fig. 1b (more images in Supplementary Fig. 3) that isolated Pt atoms (named as Pt 1 /OLC) were observed all over the support with no obvious nanoparticles or clusters present. Meanwhile, typical multishell fullerene structures of diameter ~5 nm and with interlayer distances

reasoning: 

Alright, the user wants me to summarize the catalyst synthesis procedures from a technical paragraph. They're role-playing me as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis. 

First, I need to identify what catalysts are being synthesized. The text mentions two: Pt₁/OLC (platinum single atoms on onion-like carbon) and Pt₁/graphene. Both involve depositing isolated platinum atoms on carbon supports using ALD.

For Pt₁/OLC, the support preparation is quite involved. They start with detonation nanodiamonds (DNDs) that get oxidized in a harsh acid mixture (H₂SO₄/HNO₃) to remove impurities and add oxygen groups. Then comes the key step - thermal annealing at varying temperatures to transform DNDs into OLC while controlling oxygen functionality. The ALD part is straightforward - just one cycle to deposit Pt atoms.

The Pt₁/graphene synthesis has more steps for support preparation. They make graphene oxide via Hummers' method modification - graphite oxidation with KMnO₄ in acid mixture, careful temperature control, peroxide addition, then extensive washing. The GO is annealed at very high temperature (1050°C) before the same single-cycle ALD.

I notice the user provided an incomplete paragraph cut off mid-sentence. I should focus on the complete procedures only. The key scientific highlights are: 1) precise oxygen control determines Pt stability, 2) single-cycle ALD prevents clustering, 3) characterization confirms atomic dispersion.

The user seems to need this for academic/research purposes - probably writing a paper or report. They want all technical details preserved but in condensed form. I'll maintain exact parameters (temperatures, concentrations, times) since they're crucial for reproducibility. Should also emphasize why each step matters - like how annealing transforms DND→OLC or removes oxygen groups.

Hmm, the graphene oxide synthesis description is particularly detailed. Must ensure I capture all washing steps (HCl then water to pH7) and freeze-drying. For Pt₁/OLC, the temperature dependence (>900°C for transformation) is critical.

I'll structure it as two clear synthesis pathways with sub-sections for support prep and ALD. The "why" behind procedures (like oxygen tuning for Pt anchoring) deserves explicit mention since it's fundamental to catalyst design. Characterization methods like HAADF-STEM can be noted briefly as proof of concept.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, two platinum single-atom catalysts (SACs) were synthesized: **Pt₁/OLC (Platinum single atoms on Onion-Like Carbon)** and **Pt₁/graphene (Platinum single atoms on graphene)**. Both utilize Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) for Pt deposition but differ in the carbon support preparation.

Here are the detailed synthesis procedures:

**1. Synthesis of Pt₁/OLC (Pt Single Atoms on Onion-Like Carbon)**
    *   **Support Preparation (OLC from DND):**
        1.  **Starting Material:** Pristine Detonation Nanodiamonds (DND) powder (Henan Union Abrasive Co. Ltd).
        2.  **Oxidation:** 1 g DND added to 100 ml mixture of H₂SO₄/HNO₃ (3:1 v/v). Refluxed at 160 °C for 24 hours. Purpose: Remove amorphous carbon and graft oxygen functional groups.
        3.  **Washing:** Cooled mixture washed with deionized water multiple times until pH = 7 is reached.
        4.  **Thermal Annealing (Deoxygenation & Transformation):** The oxidized DND is thermally annealed at various temperatures.
            *   Purpose: Precisely tune the type and density of oxygen species. Critical for stabilizing Pt atoms.
            *   Transformation: At elevated temperatures (>900 °C), the DND automatically transforms into Onion-Like Carbon (OLC) (confirmed by characterization). This step also engineers vacancy defects.
    *   **Pt Deposition:**
        1.  **Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD):** A **single cycle** of ALD is performed on the prepared OLC support using a Pt precursor. The exact timing sequence is referenced as being the same as that used for Pt₁/graphene (though not detailed here).
        2.  **Result:** Isolated Pt atoms dispersed on the OLC support (confirmed by HAADF-STEM), named Pt₁/OLC.

**2. Synthesis of Pt₁/graphene (Pt Single Atoms on Graphene)**
    *   **Support Preparation (Graphene Oxide & Reduced Graphene):**
        1.  **Starting Material:** Graphite flakes (1.0 g).
        2.  **Acid Mixture:** 120 ml concentrated H₂SO₄ and 14 ml H₃PO₄ added to graphite.
        3.  **Oxidation:** Temperature held at 35-40 °C. 6 g KMnO₄ slowly added.
        4.  **Reaction:** Mixture stirred at 50 °C for 12 hours.
        5.  **Quenching & Color Change:** Cooled mixture poured onto ice with several drops of 30 wt% H₂O₂ until the solution turns yellow.
        6.  **Filtration & Washing:**
            *   Precipitates filtered out.
            *   Washed with 300 ml of 5 wt% HCl three times.
            *   Washed with deionized water multiple times until pH = 7 is attained.
        7.  **Drying:** Final product (graphene oxide nanosheets) freeze-dried.
        8.  **Annealing (Reduction):** Freeze-dried graphene oxide annealed at 1,050 °C for 10 minutes under an Ar atmosphere. This produces the reduced graphene support.
    *   **Pt Deposition:**
        1.  **Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD):** A **single cycle** of ALD is performed on the annealed graphene support using a Pt precursor. The timing sequence is identical to that used for Pt₁/OLC.
        2.  **Result:** Isolated Pt atoms dispersed on the graphene support, named Pt₁/graphene.

**Key Scientific Points from the Synthesis Description:**

*   **Goal:** Synthesize platinum **single-atom catalysts** (Pt SACs) on carbon supports.
*   **Critical Support Engineering:** Both syntheses emphasize engineering the carbon support surface (oxygen functional groups, defects via annealing) as essential for stabilizing isolated Pt atoms and preventing aggregation into nanoparticles or clusters.
*   **ALD Role:** A **single cycle** of ALD is crucial in both cases to deposit only isolated Pt atoms ("Pt₁") rather than clusters or particles.
*   **Support Differences:**
    *   **Pt₁/OLC:** Uses DND-derived OLC. Transformation and surface tuning occur via controlled thermal annealing of oxidized DND.
    *   **Pt₁/graphene:** Uses Hummers-method derived GO, which is then reduced via high-temperature annealing.
*   **Confirmation:** The atomic dispersion of Pt on OLC (Pt₁/OLC) was confirmed by HAADF-STEM imaging, showing isolated atoms without nanoparticles or clusters.

**In summary:** The catalysts synthesized are **Platinum Single Atoms on Onion-Like Carbon (Pt₁/OLC)** and **Platinum Single Atoms on Graphene (Pt₁/graphene)**. Both involve precise engineering of the carbon support surface (via oxidation and controlled thermal annealing) followed by deposition of isolated Pt atoms using precisely **one cycle of Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD)**.
