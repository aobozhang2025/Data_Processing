question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Catalyst preparation. Supported Pt catalysts with different Pt loadings (0.05, 0.08, 0.2 and 0.5 wt%) were synthesized using the wet-impregnation method. The dried materials were then heat treated in a number of ways and tested for the chemoselective hydrogenation of 3-NS. For a typical catalyst preparation (2 g), the requisite amount of aqueous hydrogen hexachloroplatinic acid solution (9.6 mg Pt ml–1, assay 30.21% H2PtCl6, Johnson Matthey) was diluted to 16 ml using deionized water, and heated in an oil bath to 60 °C with vigorous stirring (800 r.p.m.) before the addition of the requisite amount of support (TiO2, Evonik P25). The temperature was subsequently increased to 95 °C for 16 h to dry the slurry in air. The resultant material was then ground thoroughly (referred to as the ‘fresh dried-only’ sample). A portion (500 mg) of the dried-only sample was either calcined in static air or reduced under a steady flow of 5% H2/Ar. Heat treatments were carried out at 450 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. All of these materials were tested as catalysts without any further treatment unless stated otherwise.

reasoning: 

Alright, let me approach this systematically. The user wants a chemist's summary of catalyst synthesis from a technical paragraph. First, I need to identify the core components: catalyst composition, synthesis method, and processing details.

The catalyst is platinum on titania support with varying loadings (0.05-0.5 wt%). The synthesis uses wet impregnation - a standard technique where we deposit active metal onto a support material. The precursor is H₂PtCl₆ solution, and support is TiO₂ P25.

Now examining the procedure step by step: they start by diluting the platinum solution, heating to 60°C with stirring. Adding support is critical - it must be done carefully to ensure uniform dispersion. Then they ramp temperature to 95°C for prolonged drying (16 hours). This slow drying likely prevents particle agglomeration.

Post-drying, they describe "fresh dried-only" material, but that's not the final catalyst. The key activation steps are calcination or reduction at 450°C. This will transform the platinum salt into active metallic Pt or PtO species. The heating rate (10°C/min) matters for controlled decomposition.

Important to note: all testing uses catalysts after these heat treatments without further processing. The user probably needs this detail for reproducibility. 

As a catalysis specialist, I should emphasize why these steps matter: the drying temperature affects moisture removal, calcination removes chloride ligands, and reduction creates active metal sites. The P25 support is significant too - its high surface area stabilizes small Pt particles.

The response should maintain technical precision while being accessible. Need to balance completeness with conciseness, highlighting both the "what" and "why" of each step for a professional chemist audience.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here's a professional summary of the catalyst synthesized and its detailed synthesis procedure:

**Catalyst Synthesized:**
*   **Composition:** Platinum (Pt) nanoparticles supported on Titanium Dioxide (TiO₂, Evonik P25).
*   **Pt Loadings:** 0.05 wt%, 0.08 wt%, 0.2 wt%, and 0.5 wt% Pt relative to the total catalyst weight.
*   **Form:** Powdered solid catalyst.
*   **Activation State:** Materials tested were either calcined in air or reduced in H₂/Ar after the initial drying/impregnation step.

**Detailed Synthesis Procedure:**

1.  **Solution Preparation:**
    *   Aqueous Hydrogen Hexachloroplatinic Acid (H₂PtCl₆) solution (Johnson Matthey, 9.6 mg Pt/ml, assay 30.21% H₂PtCl₆) is used as the Pt precursor.
    *   The precise volume of H₂PtCl₆ solution required to achieve the target Pt loading (for a 2g *total* catalyst batch) is measured.
    *   This precursor solution is diluted with deionized water to a total volume of 16 ml.

2.  **Impregnation:**
    *   The diluted precursor solution is placed in a vessel (likely a round-bottom flask or beaker) in an oil bath.
    *   The solution is heated to **60 °C** under **vigorous stirring (800 rpm)**.
    *   Once at 60 °C, the requisite amount of **TiO₂ support (Evonik P25)** is added to the solution, forming a slurry.
    *   **Note:** The amount of TiO₂ added is calculated such that, after drying and incorporating the Pt, the final catalyst has the desired Pt loading (e.g., for 0.5 wt% Pt on 2g catalyst, 10 mg Pt is needed, requiring ~1.04 ml of stock solution; TiO₂ added would be 1990 mg).

3.  **Drying:**
    *   After adding the support, the oil bath temperature is increased to **95 °C**.
    *   The slurry is maintained at **95 °C** under stirring (**800 rpm**) for **16 hours**.
    *   Drying occurs **in air** (the vessel is open to the atmosphere).
    *   The goal is to evaporate the water, depositing the Pt precursor onto the TiO₂ surface.

4.  **Post-Drying Processing ("Dried-only"):**
    *   The dried material is removed from the vessel.
    *   This material is **ground thoroughly** to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle or equivalent.
    *   This powder is referred to as the **"fresh dried-only"** sample. At this stage, Pt is likely present as H₂PtCl₆ or decomposed chloride species adsorbed on TiO₂.

5.  **Activation (Heat Treatment):**
    *   A portion (**500 mg**) of the "dried-only" powder is subjected to one of two heat treatments:
        *   **Option 1: Calcination:** Heated in **static air**.
        *   **Option 2: Reduction:** Heated under a **steady flow of 5% H₂/Ar**.
    *   **Heat Treatment Parameters (Same for both):**
        *   **Temperature:** **450 °C**
        *   **Duration:** **4 hours**
        *   **Heating Rate:** **10 °C min⁻¹** (ramped from room temperature to 450 °C at this rate).
    *   *Calcination* aims to decompose the Pt precursor salt and remove chloride ligands, likely forming PtOₓ species.
    *   *Reduction* aims to convert the Pt precursor directly to metallic Pt(0) nanoparticles.
    *   The material is cooled after treatment (cooling rate not specified).

6.  **Final Catalyst:**
    *   The **calcined** or **reduced** materials are the **active catalysts** used for testing the chemoselective hydrogenation of 3-Nitrostyrene (3-NS).
    *   These catalysts are used **without any further treatment** prior to catalytic testing.

**Key Synthesis Features:**
*   **Method:** Wet Impregnation (Incipient Wetness method implied by volume/support ratio).
*   **Precursor:** H₂PtCl₆ (aqueous).
*   **Support:** TiO₂ (Evonik P25 - a high-surface-area anatase/rutile mix).
*   **Drying:** Slow (16h), Elevated Temp (95°C), Stirring (to ensure homogeneity).
*   **Activation:** Mandatory post-drying step (Calcination or Reduction at 450°C for 4h).
*   **Form:** Fine powder.
