question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Synthesis and characterization of the SA-Rh/CN catalyst SA-Rh/CN was synthesized via a host–guest strategy. Figure 1a presents a schematic to demonstrate the preparation of SA-Rh/CN. Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks with molecular-scale cages (ZIF-8) were employed to disperse and immobilize Rh(acac) 3 , because the dimensions of Rh(acac) 3 (9.36 Å) are between the size of the large cav- ities (diameter of 11.6 Å) and the size of the small pores (diameter of 3.4 Å) of ZIF-8. The Rh(acac) 3 can thus be trapped within the molec- ular cages of the ZIF-8 (denoted Rh/ZIF-8). During pyrolysis, Rh/ ZIF-8 is reduced in situ to form SA-Rh/CN (for details see Methods). Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns reveal no differences between the ZIF-8 and Rh/ZIF-8, suggesting the homogeneous dis- tribution of Rh(acac) 3 in ZIF-8 (Supplementary Fig. 1), while the PXRD patterns and Raman spectra reveal the nature of defective amorphous carbon in SA-Rh/CN (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3).

Synthesis. Typical preparation of Rh/ZIF-8 and Pd/ZIF-8. Rh(acac) 3 (144 mg) and Zn(NO 3 ) 2 (1.19 g) were dissolved in 15 ml methanol (denoted solution A). 2-Methylimidazole (1.31 g) was dissolved in 30 ml methanol (denoted solution B). Solutions A and B were each stirred for 5 min. Both solutions were poured into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (volume, 50 ml). After heating at 120 °C for 4 h, the sealed autoclave was cooled to room temperature. The product (yellowish powder) was collected by centrifugation and washed with DMF and methanol three times each. The same procedure was utilized for the synthesis of Pd/ZIF-8 and Pt/ZIF-8 by using Pd(acac) 2 (80 mg) and Pt(acac) 2 (60 mg), respectively, instead of Rh(acac) 3 .

Typical preparation of SA-Rh/CN (3 h), Rh/CN-2h, Rh/CN-4h, Rh/CN-5h, Rh/ CN-1100 SA-Pd/CN and SA-Pt/CN. Rh/ZIF-8 (1 g) was added to a crucible. The crucible was then placed in a tube-type furnace and heated to 900 °C for 2–5 h (1,100 °C for 6 h to prepare Rh/CN-1100) at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 under a N 2 atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, SA-Rh/CN (black powder) was obtained. The product could be used directly without further treatment. The same procedure was utilized for the synthesis of SA-Pd/CN and SA-Pt/CN by using Pd/ZIF-8 (1 g) and Pt/ZIF-8 (1 g), respectively, instead of Rh/ZIF-8 (1 g).

Typical preparation of Rh/C. RhCl 3 ·3H 2 O (50 mg) was added to 10 ml deionized water under vigorous stirring at room temperature. NaBH 4 (72 mg) in 10 ml deionized water was added dropwise to RhCl 3 solution. After 5 min, black nanocrystals were collected by centrifugation. Rh nanoparticles were washed with ethanol three times and dried at 70 °C. Vulcan XC-72 (100 mg) was added into 100 ml ethanol. Under vigorous stirring, 20 mg prepared Rh nanoparticles were added to the suspension at room temperature then stirred continuously for 4 h. The catalyst was collected by centrifugation. Rh/C was dried at 70 °C for 12 h to remove the solvent, then the solid was used for electrochemical measurements without further purification.

reasoning: 

Alright, the user wants me to summarize the catalyst synthesis from a detailed paragraph. Let me start by understanding the key components. The catalyst is SA-Rh/CN, which stands for Single Atom Rhodium on Carbon Nitride. 

First, they use a host-guest strategy with ZIF-8. Why ZIF-8? Because its cage sizes (11.6 Å and 3.4 Å) can trap Rh(acac)3, which is 9.36 Å. That makes sense for dispersion. The synthesis has two main parts: making Rh/ZIF-8 and then pyrolysis.

For Rh/ZIF-8, they dissolve Rh(acac)3 and Zn(NO3)2 in methanol (Solution A), and 2-methylimidazole in another methanol solution (Solution B). Mixing both in an autoclave, heating at 120°C for 4 hours. The yellowish powder is washed with DMF and methanol. PXRD shows no difference from pure ZIF-8, indicating good dispersion.

Then, pyrolysis: Rh/ZIF-8 heated to 900°C under N2 for 2-5 hours (or 1100°C for Rh/CN-1100). The heating rate is 5°C/min. The product is black powder SA-Rh/CN. Characterization shows defective amorphous carbon structure via PXRD and Raman.

They also mention other catalysts like SA-Pd/CN and SA-Pt/CN using the same method but with Pd(acac)2 or Pt(acac)2. Plus, Rh/C is made separately using RhCl3·3H2O, NaBH4 reduction, and loading on Vulcan carbon.

The user is likely a chemist or researcher needing a clear, concise synthesis procedure. They might be planning to replicate this or compare with other catalysts. Highlighting the host-guest strategy, pyrolysis conditions, and characterization results is crucial. Also, noting the single-atom nature and why ZIF-8 works as a host. Ensuring all steps and conditions are precise, like temperatures, times, and reagents, is important for reproducibility.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here is a professional summary of the synthesized catalyst and its detailed synthesis procedure:

**Synthesized Catalyst:**  
**SA-Rh/CN**  
*   **Full Name:** Single-Atom Rhodium supported on Carbon Nitride.
*   **Key Feature:** Rhodium (Rh) is atomically dispersed on a defective amorphous carbon nitride (CN) support, derived from ZIF-8.
*   **Evidence:** PXRD and Raman spectroscopy confirm the carbon nitride support is defective and amorphous. The host-guest strategy using ZIF-8 cages is designed to prevent Rh aggregation and form single atoms (SA).

**Synthesis Procedure (SA-Rh/CN):**

The synthesis is a two-step process: **(1) Formation of Rh/ZIF-8 Precursor** and **(2) Pyrolysis to SA-Rh/CN**.

**1.  Synthesis of Rh/ZIF-8 Precursor (Host-Guest Complex):**
    *   **Solution A:** Dissolve 144 mg Rh(acac)₃ (Rhodium(III) acetylacetonate) and 1.19 g Zn(NO₃)₂ (Zinc nitrate) in 15 ml methanol. Stir for 5 minutes.
    *   **Solution B:** Dissolve 1.31 g 2-Methylimidazole (organic linker) in 30 ml methanol. Stir for 5 minutes.
    *   **Combination:** Pour both Solution A and Solution B into a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave.
    *   **Reaction:** Seal the autoclave and heat at 120 °C for 4 hours.
    *   **Workup:** Cool the autoclave to room temperature. Collect the yellowish solid product by centrifugation.
    *   **Washing:** Wash the solid thoroughly three times with DMF (Dimethylformamide) and three times with methanol.
    *   **Product:** Rh/ZIF-8 (Rh(acac)₃ encapsulated within ZIF-8 cages). PXRD confirms homogenous dispersion of Rh(acac)₃ within the intact ZIF-8 framework.

**2.  Synthesis of SA-Rh/CN via Pyrolysis:**
    *   **Loading:** Place 1 g of the dried Rh/ZIF-8 precursor into a crucible.
    *   **Furnace Setup:** Place the crucible in a tube-type furnace under a flowing N₂ (Nitrogen) atmosphere.
    *   **Pyrolysis Program:** Heat the furnace to 900 °C at a controlled heating rate of 5 °C min⁻¹. Hold at 900 °C for a specific duration (2h, 3h, 4h, or 5h) to obtain Rh/CN-Xh. *(Note: To obtain Rh/CN-1100, heat to 1100 °C for 6h at the same ramp rate).*
    *   **Cooling:** Allow the furnace to cool naturally to room temperature under N₂ flow.
    *   **Product:** Obtain SA-Rh/CN as a black powder directly usable without further treatment.
    *   **Characterization:** PXRD and Raman spectra confirm the transformation into defective amorphous carbon nitride (CN) with Rh present as single atoms (SA-Rh).

**Key Synthesis Details & Rationale:**

1.  **Host-Guest Strategy:** ZIF-8 is chosen because the size of the Rh(acac)₃ molecule (9.36 Å) is larger than ZIF-8's small pore windows (3.4 Å) but smaller than its large cavities (11.6 Å). This allows Rh(acac)₃ to enter the cages during synthesis but prevents its escape ("trapping"), ensuring atomic dispersion.
2.  **In Situ Reduction:** During the high-temperature pyrolysis under inert atmosphere (N₂), the ZIF-8 framework carbonizes into nitrogen-doped carbon (CN), and the Rh³⁺ ions in Rh(acac)₃ are simultaneously reduced *in situ* to form Rh⁰ single atoms anchored on the CN support.
3.  **Morphology Control:** Varying the pyrolysis time (2-5h) or temperature (1100°C) allows tuning the catalyst properties (denoted as Rh/CN-Xh or Rh/CN-1100).
4.  **Generality:** The identical procedure (steps 1 & 2) using Pd(acac)₂ or Pt(acac)₂ instead of Rh(acac)₃ yields SA-Pd/CN and SA-Pt/CN, respectively.
5.  **Contrast (Rh/C):** A conventional Rh nanoparticle catalyst on Vulcan carbon (Rh/C) is synthesized separately for comparison via NaBH₄ reduction of RhCl₃·3H₂O in water, followed by deposition onto carbon black.

**In summary:** SA-Rh/CN is synthesized by trapping Rh(acac)₃ within ZIF-8 cages to form Rh/ZIF-8, followed by controlled pyrolysis under N₂ at 900°C (for 2-5h) to simultaneously carbonize the framework and reduce Rh to single atoms dispersed on the resulting defective amorphous carbon nitride support.
