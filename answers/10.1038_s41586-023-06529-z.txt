question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Synthesis of PCN Bulk PCN was prepared by calcining dicyandiamide at 550 °C (2.3 °C min −1 heating rate) in a crucible for 3 h in static air. Exfoliated PCN was obtained by thermal exfoliation at 500 °C (5 °C min −1 heating rate) for 5 h in static air. The exfoliation procedure was repeated several times until the PCN was exfoliated efficiently.

Synthesis of Cu g /PCN CuCl 2 (0.64 g) and exfoliated PCN (0.70 g) were dispersed in 200 ml for- mamide, sonicated for 10 min and then stirred in an oil bath (120 °C) for 12 h, following centrifugation and washing thoroughly by ethanol several times. The oven-dried powder (80 °C) was subsequently heated to 500 °C with a heating rate of 2 °C min −1 and kept for 5 h with the protection of N 2 flow. Cu 1 /PCN with Cu contents of 0.2, 0.9, 1.8, 8.0 and 10.8 wt% were prepared using 0.2, 1.0, 2.0, 10.0 and 15.0 wt% Cu feeding, respectively.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalysts and procedures from a given paragraph. Let me start by reading the provided text carefully.

First, the synthesis involves two catalysts: bulk PCN and exfoliated PCN, followed by Cu-modified versions. The bulk PCN is made by calcining dicyandiamide at 550°C with a specific heating rate. Then, exfoliated PCN is created through thermal exfoliation at 500°C. The repetition of exfoliation is crucial here to ensure efficiency. 

Next, the Cu/PCN catalysts. The procedure mentions using CuCl₂ and exfoliated PCN dispersed in formamide. Steps include sonication, stirring in an oil bath, centrifugation, washing with ethanol, drying, and then a thermal treatment under nitrogen. The different Cu loadings are achieved by varying the initial Cu feeding percentages. 

I need to present this clearly. Breaking it into sections for each catalyst makes sense. Highlighting precursors, conditions, and key steps like heating rates and atmospheres is important. The user probably needs precise details for replication, so exact temperatures, times, and quantities are essential. 

Also, the note on Cu feeding percentages versus actual Cu content should be included. The user might be interested in how the theoretical feeding translates to the final product's composition. Mentioning the protective N₂ flow during annealing is critical for preventing oxidation. 

Wait, should I mention the centrifugation and washing steps? Yes, because purification is a key part of synthesis. The repeated washing with ethanol ensures removal of impurities. Drying at 80°C is standard but necessary to note. 

For the thermal treatments, specifying static air versus N₂ atmosphere is important for reproducibility. The user might be a researcher or student needing this for lab work. Ensuring all parameters are explicit will help them avoid mistakes. 

Also, the transition from bulk to exfoliated PCN is foundational for the Cu deposition. Explaining that exfoliation increases surface area, which benefits catalyst performance, adds context. The annealing step after Cu deposition likely aids in stabilizing the copper species on the PCN support. 

I should verify units: temperatures in °C, heating rates in °C/min, times in hours. Quantities like 0.64g CuCl₂ and 0.70g PCN must be accurate. The solvent volume (200 ml formamide) and sonication duration (10 min) are part of the procedure. 

The different Cu loadings (0.2 to 10.8 wt%) based on feeding percentages show scalability. Highlighting that the actual Cu content varies slightly from the feeding amount could be important for their experimental design. 

Overall, structuring the synthesis steps chronologically ensures clarity. Using bullet points or numbered steps in the response will make it digestible. Confirming that all details from the paragraph are covered without adding external information is key. The user emphasized "all details," so nothing should be omitted.
