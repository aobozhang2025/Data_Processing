question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Synthesis of PCN Bulk PCN was prepared by calcining dicyandiamide at 550 °C (2.3 °C min −1 heating rate) in a crucible for 3 h in static air. Exfoliated PCN was obtained by thermal exfoliation at 500 °C (5 °C min −1 heating rate) for 5 h in static air. The exfoliation procedure was repeated several times until the PCN was exfoliated efficiently.

Synthesis of Cu g /PCN CuCl 2 (0.64 g) and exfoliated PCN (0.70 g) were dispersed in 200 ml for- mamide, sonicated for 10 min and then stirred in an oil bath (120 °C) for 12 h, following centrifugation and washing thoroughly by ethanol several times. The oven-dried powder (80 °C) was subsequently heated to 500 °C with a heating rate of 2 °C min −1 and kept for 5 h with the protection of N 2 flow. Cu 1 /PCN with Cu contents of 0.2, 0.9, 1.8, 8.0 and 10.8 wt% were prepared using 0.2, 1.0, 2.0, 10.0 and 15.0 wt% Cu feeding, respectively.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalysts and procedures from the given paragraph. Let me carefully parse this technical text.

Hmm, the paragraph describes two distinct syntheses: first a bulk polymer carbon nitride (PCN) material, then a copper-modified PCN catalyst. The user seems to need clear, structured technical details - probably for research replication or literature review purposes. 

Breaking it down: The PCN synthesis involves straightforward calcination of dicyandiamide at 550°C with specific heating parameters. Interesting that they use static air atmosphere - that affects the condensation chemistry. Then thermal exfoliation creates layered nanosheets, which is crucial for creating high-surface-area catalyst supports.

For the Cu/PCN catalyst, I notice multiple precision details: exact mass ratios, solvent choice (formamide), sonication parameters, and staged thermal treatments. The nitrogen-protected annealing at 500°C suggests copper stabilization is sensitive to oxidation. The varying copper percentages indicate they're studying doping effects. 

The user didn't specify, but they might need this for: 
1) Lab replication - hence I'll emphasize all quantitative details 
2) Understanding structure-property relationships - so I'll highlight how synthesis steps affect material architecture
3) Possibly comparing with other catalyst systems

I should maintain formal chemistry terminology while ensuring procedural clarity. The copper loading percentages are particularly critical - they directly correlate with catalytic performance. Also worth noting the repeated exfoliation step shows material optimization was iterative.

        *   Wash the solid thoroughly with ethanol several times.
        *   Dry the washed solid in an oven at 80 °C to obtain a powder.

    *   **Varying Copper Loading:** To achieve different Cu loadings (0.9, 1.8, 8.0, and 10.8 wt% Cu), the procedure above was repeated using different initial amounts of CuCl₂ in the impregnation step, corresponding to Cu *feeding* percentages of 1.0, 2.0, 10.0, and 15.0 wt% relative to the PCN, respectively. The actual final Cu content (wt%) achieved for each feeding percentage is listed.

*   **Precision:** Controlled heating rates, temperatures, times, atmospheres, and precursor ratios are critical. Washing removes excess/unreacted salts. Drying prevents aggregation before thermal treatment. The N₂ atmosphere prevents copper oxidation during annealing.
