question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Synthesis of Aza-CMP. A total of 532.5 mg (1.875 mmol) of 1,2,4,5-benzenetetramine tetrahydrochloride in 15 ml of anhydrous DMF and 390 mg (1.25 mmol) of hexaketocyclohexane octahydrate in 5 ml of anhydrous DMF were mixed and refluxed for 48 h under Ar. The resulting dark-brown solid was purified via hot extraction with methanol for 48 h using a Soxhlet extractor, then dried under vacuum at 150 °C for 24 h. Protonation-assisted exfoliation of the as-prepared bulk polymer was performed according to the reported literature18. To summarize, Aza-CMP (100 mg) was dispersed in 100 ml of 12 M HCl, and the suspension was subjected to ultrasonication for 24 h. The mixture was diluted with deionized water and centrifuged at 2,000 r.p.m. for 10 min to separate large aggregates. Exfoliated nanosheets were collected by filter (polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), 45 μm) and washed thoroughly with water.

Synthesis of Aza-CMP-Co. Aza-CMP material was modified with Co2+ using cobalt(II) acetate. Aza-CMP (20 mg) was immersed in 10 ml of anhydrous DMF and the suspension stirred for 1 h under an Ar atmosphere, with the gas bubbling through the solution. Next, 85 mg (1.5 eq. with respect to phenanthroline units) of cobalt(II) acetate was dissolved in 10 ml of anhydrous DMF under Ar. The Co solution was slowly added to the suspension under Ar, and the mixture was maintained in a dispersed state by ultrasonication for 8 h at room temperature. The solid was filtered and then washed with DMF, water, methanol and ethanol until the filtrate became colourless. Finally, the product was dried at 80 °C under vacuum conditions. Aza-CMP-Co (exfoliated) was fabricated via the same procedure while replacing the as-prepared bulk Aza-CMP with exfoliated Aza-CMP.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to summarize the synthesis procedures for Aza-CMP and Aza-CMP-Co catalysts from a technical paragraph. They specifically asked for all details as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis.

Looking at the text, I see two distinct synthesis procedures: one for the base polymer Aza-CMP and another for its cobalt-modified version Aza-CMP-Co. The user seems to need a clear, structured breakdown with precise chemical names, quantities, reaction conditions, and purification steps.

For Aza-CMP synthesis, the key components are 1,2,4,5-benzenetetramine tetrahydrochloride and hexaketocyclohexane octahydrate. The reaction happens in anhydrous DMF under argon with 48-hour reflux. The purification involves Soxhlet extraction with methanol and vacuum drying at high temperature. Then there's an exfoliation step using HCl and ultrasonication to create nanosheets - this part references literature but still provides operational details like centrifugation parameters and PTFE filtration.

The Aza-CMP-Co synthesis involves cobalt(II) acetate coordination. I notice it specifies "1.5 eq. with respect to phenanthroline units" - that's important stoichiometric information. The process has careful atmosphere control (Ar bubbling), ultrasonication for dispersion, and thorough washing to remove excess cobalt. They also mention the exfoliated version uses the same method but starts with pre-exfoliated material.

As a chemistry professional, I should highlight critical details: solvent choices (anhydrous DMF for moisture sensitivity), inert atmosphere needs (preventing oxidation), stoichiometric ratios, and the purpose of each purification step. The exfoliation part is particularly relevant for catalyst surface area enhancement. I'll organize this into two clear sections with bullet points for readability while maintaining all technical precision the user requested.

        *   Methanol (further purification, solvent exchange)
        *   Ethanol (final wash, aids drying)
    *   Washing continued until the filtrate ran colourless (indicating removal of excess/unbound cobalt species).
    *   Final product dried at 80 °C under vacuum conditions.
