question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Catalyst preparation. The Au 1 –O x –Na 9 –(OH) y /TiO 2 catalysts were made by IWI of a solution prepared as detailed below. Gold loadings of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 wt% were prepared by a single-step IWI of the designed amount of the gold solution. To prepare the solution, the proper amount of Au(OH) 3 powder was suspended in 30 ml of H 2 O with O 2 sparging and heated to 80 °C. NaOH powder (atomic ratio of Au:Na = 1:9) was added into the slurry at the same temperature. The mixture was refluxed at 80 °C overnight to obtain a transparent solution (colourless at lower concentrations to light yellow at higher concentrations). The Au 1 –O x –Na 9 –(OH) y / TiO 2 catalysts were prepared by IWI of the gold solution at RT in air. The solution was concentrated by heating followed by drying at 200 °C with N 2 protection, and then the sample was further dried in vacuum overnight at 80 °C.

reasoning: 

Alright, the user wants me to act as a chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalyst and its preparation from the given paragraph. Let me start by understanding the key components of the catalyst mentioned: Au₁–Oₓ–Na₉–(OH)ᵧ/TiO₂. The notation suggests a gold-oxygen-sodium-hydroxyl complex supported on titanium dioxide. 

First, I need to parse the synthesis method, which is IWI (incipient wetness impregnation). The gold loadings are 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 wt%, prepared in a single step. The solution preparation starts with suspending Au(OH)₃ powder in water with O₂ sparging, heating to 80°C. Then NaOH is added in a specific Au:Na ratio of 1:9. Refluxing overnight leads to a transparent solution, which varies in color based on concentration. 

Next, the actual catalyst synthesis involves impregnating TiO₂ with this solution at room temperature. The drying steps are crucial: concentrating by heating, drying at 200°C under N₂, then vacuum drying at 80°C overnight. I should note the protective atmospheres (N₂ and vacuum) to prevent decomposition or oxidation.

The user might be a researcher or student needing a clear, concise summary for replication or understanding. They probably want all procedural details without omissions. Key points include the reagents, conditions (temps, times, atmospheres), and observations (solution color change). Ensuring accuracy in ratios and steps is vital. Also, explaining why certain steps are done, like O₂ sparging for oxidation or N₂ for protection, adds value. Need to present it step-wise but keep it professional yet accessible.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here is a professional chemist's summary of the synthesized catalyst and its detailed synthesis procedure:

**Synthesized Catalyst:**
*   **Composition:** `Au₁–Oₓ–Na₉–(OH)ᵧ / TiO₂`
*   **Description:** A supported catalyst consisting of a specific Gold-Sodium-Oxygen-Hydroxyl complex (`Au₁–Oₓ–Na₉–(OH)ᵧ`) dispersed on a Titanium Dioxide (`TiO₂`) support.
*   **Gold Loading:** Multiple catalysts prepared with nominal gold loadings of **0.5 wt%**, **1.0 wt%**, and **1.5 wt%** relative to the total catalyst weight.
*   **Preparation Method:** Single-step **Incipient Wetness Impregnation (IWI)**.

**Detailed Synthesis Procedure:**

1.  **Precursor Solution Preparation:**
    *   Suspend the calculated amount of `Au(OH)₃` powder in **30 ml of deionized water**.
    *   Sparge the suspension with **O₂ gas** (continuous bubbling).
    *   Heat the sparged suspension to **80 °C**.
    *   While maintaining **80 °C**, add the calculated amount of `NaOH` powder to the slurry. The amount is determined by the **atomic ratio Au:Na = 1:9**.
    *   **Reflux** the resulting mixture at **80 °C** for **overnight** (typically 12-16 hours).
    *   **Result:** Formation of a **transparent solution**. The color ranges from **colourless (for lower Au concentrations)** to **light yellow (for higher Au concentrations)**.

2.  **Catalyst Synthesis via IWI:**
    *   Perform **Incipient Wetness Impregnation (IWI)** of the `TiO₂` support using the prepared `Au₁–Oₓ–Na₉–(OH)ᵧ` precursor solution.
    *   Impregnation is carried out at **Room Temperature (RT)**.
    *   Impregnation is performed in **air**.

3.  **Drying:**
    *   **Concentration:** After impregnation, the wet catalyst is **heated** (temperature not specified, implied gentle heating below 80°C) to evaporate excess solvent (water).
    *   **Primary Drying:** Transfer the concentrated material to an oven and dry under a protective atmosphere of **N₂ gas** at **200 °C**. (Duration not specified).
    *   **Secondary Drying:** Further dry the sample **in vacuum** (reduced pressure) **overnight** (typically 12-16 hours) at **80 °C**.

**Key Observations & Details:**
*   The active gold species is synthesized *in solution* (`Au₁–Oₓ–Na₉–(OH)ᵧ`) *before* being loaded onto the support.
*   `O₂` sparging and heating during precursor preparation likely facilitate the dissolution of `Au(OH)₃` and the formation of the soluble gold-sodium complex.
*   The precise stoichiometry (`Oₓ`, `(OH)ᵧ`) of the complex is not defined in the text but is implied by the synthesis conditions and Au:Na ratio.
*   The `Au:Na = 1:9` atomic ratio is critical for forming the desired soluble complex.
*   Protective atmospheres (`N₂` during 200°C drying, vacuum during 80°C drying) are used to prevent unwanted decomposition or oxidation of the precursor complex during thermal treatment.
*   No calcination step is mentioned; the final material after vacuum drying is the catalyst.

This procedure results in a `TiO₂`-supported catalyst containing a specific sodium-stabilized gold-oxo/hydroxo complex (`Au₁–Oₓ–Na₉–(OH)ᵧ`) at controlled gold loadings.
