question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Results Catalyst synthesis and characterization Photocatalytic Bi 2 WO 6 was selected as the support, and was obtained from Bi 2 WO 6 /amorphous BiOCl nanosheets previously reported by our group 13 . A series of palladium-based Bi 2 WO 6 photocatalysts were pre- pared using a facile three-step method (Fig. 1a). The surface of Bi 2 WO 6 can expose coordinatively unsaturated –Bi/–O atoms after the removal of the amorphous BiOCl component by nitric acid and subsequent hydrogen treatment (to produce the BWO support (Supplementary Fig. 1)). Subsequently, palladium was dispersed on the BWO surface in single-atom form by impregnation, and the coordination environ- ment was regulated by controlling the calcination temperature in air. The as-prepared photocatalysts are denoted as Pd–O 4 /BWO and Pd– O 3 /BWO in accordance with the Pd–O coordination number (Fig. 1a). Supported palladium nanoparticle photocatalysts (Pd NP /BWO) were prepared by thermal reduction. The palladium content was determined to be approximately 0.05 wt.% for Pd–O 4 /BWO and Pd–O 3 /BWO, and 0.5 wt.% for Pd Np /BWO by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (Supplementary Table 2). The photocatalysts exhibited a nanosheet morphology with numerous small nanoplate units, consistent with the BWO substrate (Supplementary Fig. 2). X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) excludes the existence of metallic palladium and PdO x on Pd–O 4 /BWO and Pd– O 3 /BWO (Supplementary Fig. 3). Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) showed some brighter atoms encircled in yellow,

Pd–O 3 /BWO, 50 mg of BWO nanosheet was impregnated with 100 μl of 0.25 mg Pd ml −1 PdCl 2 /acetonitrile solution. After impregnation, the sample was dried at 60 °C for 30 min and then calcinated in a muffle furnace at 175 °C for 3 h. The impregnation step remained the same for preparing 0.05 wt% Pd–O 4 /BWO, apart from changing the calcination temperature to 250 °C. Palladium nanoparticle loading was followed by thermal reduction: for the preparation of 0.5 wt% Pd Np /BWO, 100 mg BWO, 7.5 mg ascorbic acid, 7.5 mg citric acid and 25 mg polyvinylpyr- rolidone (mol. wt, 55,000) were added to 9 ml deionized water at 80 °C under vigorous stirring. After 30 min, 1.85 ml of 1 mg ml −1 K 2 PdCl 6 solu- tion was injected into the solution dropwise and kept stirring for 4 h. Finally, the solid was collected by centrifugation, washed with deion- ized water and dried at 60 °C overnight, after which the supernatant was almost transparent, indicating the successful loading of palladium nanoparticles on the support.

Methods Synthesis of Pd/BWO series photocatalysts First, 0.3 g Bi 2 WO 6 /amorphous BiOCl nanosheet powder was dispersed in 11 ml HNO 3 (1.3 M) solution and stirred for 4 h. The products were then collected by centrifugation and washed with deionized water until the supernatant solution was neutral. After freeze-drying for 2 days, 0.15 g of the sample was treated in a tube furnace with 5 vol% H 2 /Ar gas at 150 °C for 5 h to introduce defects. The resulting sample was named BWO. Palladium single-atom loading was performed by a typical incipient wet-impregnation method: to prepare 0.05 wt%

reasoning: 

Okay, let me approach this as a professional catalyst synthesis chemist. The user wants me to extract and summarize the catalyst synthesis procedures from this technical paragraph. 

First, I need to identify the key catalysts being synthesized. The main materials are palladium-based Bi₂WO₆ photocatalysts in three forms: Pd-O₄/BWO and Pd-O₃/BWO (single-atom catalysts), and Pd NP/BWO (nanoparticle catalyst). 

Looking at the synthesis, it's a three-step process starting with support preparation. The Bi₂WO₆ support comes from Bi₂WO₆/amorphous BiOCl nanosheets. They treat this with nitric acid to remove BiOCl, then do hydrogen treatment at 150°C to create coordinatively unsaturated sites - that's crucial for anchoring single atoms later. 

For the single-atom catalysts, they use incipient wet impregnation with PdCl₂/acetonitrile solution. The calcination temperature determines the coordination: 175°C gives Pd-O₃, 250°C gives Pd-O₄. Interesting how precise temperature control affects atomic coordination. 

The nanoparticle version is more complex - they use a thermal reduction method with ascorbic acid, citric acid and PVP as stabilizers. Higher Pd loading (0.5 wt% vs 0.05%) and different precursor (K₂PdCl₆). The color change of supernatant indicates complete loading. 

Characterization confirms structure: XRD shows no Pd aggregates in single-atom samples, HAADF-STEM visualizes single atoms. Pd content verified by ICP-OES. Morphology remains nanosheets throughout. 

The user seems to need clear procedural details - probably for replication or literature comparison. I'll organize chronologically: support prep first, then separate procedures for each catalyst type with exact parameters (temps, concentrations, times). Should emphasize how each step affects final structure - like acid treatment creating active sites, calcination tuning coordination. 

Better include all quantitative details too: 0.25 mg Pd/ml solution, 175°C/3h calcination, etc. The nanoparticle synthesis has many components - need to list all additives and their roles (PVP for capping, acids as reducers). 

Hmm, the original text jumps between Results and Methods sections - I'll integrate them seamlessly in the summary. Also should explain why different Pd precursors were used (PdCl₂ for atoms vs K₂PdCl₆ for NPs). 

Finally, I'll highlight the key outcomes: successful synthesis of both single-atom and nanoparticle Pd on defect-engineered Bi₂WO₆, with controlled coordination environments. That's quite elegant catalyst design actually.
