question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Chemicals and synthesis All the chemicals are used as received from the provider without further purification. Tetraamminepalladium(II) nitrate solution (TAPN, 10 wt.% in H 2 O, 99.99%) and cerium(III) nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO 3 ) 3 ·6H 2 O, 99.995%) obtained from Sigma Aldrich were used as the precursors of Pd and CeO 2 . Gamma phase of aluminium oxide (CATALOX SBa-150) from Sasol was pre-calcined at 850 °C in air for 6 h and used as the refer- ence catalyst support. Single-atom Pd 1 /CeO 2 catalyst was prepared via incipient wetness impregnation followed by high-temperature calcina- tion as reported previously. Firstly, CeO 2 support with mild crystallinity was obtained via thermal decomposition of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 ·6H 2 O at 350 °C in air for 2 h. After impregnation of TAPN (1 wt.% Pd), the powders were dried overnight at 80 °C followed by calcination in static air at 800 °C for 8 h with a ramp of 5 °C min −1 . Traditional Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalyst domi- nated by supported PdO NPs was prepared by impregnating commer- cial γ-Al 2 O 3 with TAPN (1 wt.% Pd), drying the impregnated support in air at 80 °C, and calcining the powders in static air at 550 °C for 5 h with a ramp of 5 °C min −1 . The resulted catalyst was denoted as PdO/Al 2 O 3 .

Results RT activation of Pd 1 /CeO 2 for CH 4 combustion Single-atom Pd 1 /CeO 2 (1 wt.% Pd) catalyst was prepared by incipi- ent wetness impregnation, followed by 800 °C calcination in air, namely the atom-trapping process 29 . The single-atom nature of Pd 1 in as-synthesized catalyst was confirmed by combined electron micros- copy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2, and Supplementary Table 1). The conventional PdO/Al 2 O 3 catalyst (1 wt.% Pd) with PdO NPs supported on a high-surface-area γ-Al 2 O 3 was also prepared using a solution impregnation method (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4, and Supplementary Table 2) 30 . Both catalysts were evalu- ated in lean methane oxidation under industrially relevant conditions for emission control of natural gas vehicles (NGVs), including a low CH 4 concentration (680 ppm), presence of CO 2 and steam, and high gas hourly space velocity of 300 l g −1 h −1 (ref. 1).

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis. They've provided a technical paragraph and want me to extract all details about the synthesized catalysts and their preparation methods. 

Hmm, looking at this text, I notice it describes two distinct catalysts: a single-atom Pd₁/CeO₂ and a traditional PdO/Al₂O₃ nanoparticle catalyst. The user specifically asked for "all details", so I need to be meticulous about every step, precursor, and condition mentioned.

First, let's tackle the Pd₁/CeO₂ single-atom catalyst. The synthesis has multiple stages: they start by making the CeO₂ support from cerium nitrate through thermal decomposition at 350°C. Then comes the incipient wetness impregnation with TAPN solution - important to note they're using tetraamminepalladium(II) nitrate and specifying 1 wt% Pd loading. The drying step at 80°C overnight seems crucial before the high-temperature calcination at 800°C. That ramp rate of 5°C/min is probably critical for the "atom-trapping" effect they reference.

For the PdO/Al₂O₃ catalyst, it's simpler - they use commercial gamma-alumina (pre-calcined at 850°C), impregnate with same Pd precursor, same drying, but milder calcination at 550°C. Interesting how the calcination temperature difference creates either single atoms or nanoparticles.

The user mentioned being a chemist, so I should include all technical specifications: precursor purities (99.99% Pd, 99.995% Ce salt), exact temperatures, durations, ramp rates. Also worth noting the support origins - Sasol's CATALOX for alumina. 

I wonder if they need this for replication? The text mentions supplementary figures confirming the single-atom structure, but since they didn't ask for characterization data, I'll focus purely on synthesis. Should emphasize that both catalysts have same Pd loading (1 wt%) for fair comparison in methane combustion testing.

The response should clearly separate the two syntheses while maintaining all procedural nuances. Professional tone but accessible - even though they're a chemist, clarity trumps jargon. Might add a brief context about why these specific catalysts matter (methane emission control) since it's in the results section.
