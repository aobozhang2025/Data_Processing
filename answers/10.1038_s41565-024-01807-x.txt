question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Synthesis of Ir 1 /(Co,Fe)-OH/MI Ir 1 /(Co,Fe)-OH/MI was synthesized using a straightforward immer- sion technique conducted at ambient temperature and pressure. A solution was prepared by dissolving cobalt nitrate (Co(NO 3 ) 2 ∙6H 2 O, 1 mmol), iron nitrate (Fe(NO 3 ) 3 ∙6H 2 O, 1 mmol) and an Ir 3+ aqueous solution (7.14 mg ml −1 , 350 µl) in a mixture of deionized water (20 ml) and ethylene glycol (10 ml). The pH value of this solution was kept at ~4.5 by adding an appropriate amount of 2 mol l −1 NaOH. Subsequently, the pre-prepared Co-MI electrode was immersed in this solution for 20 h. Following immersion, the Ir 1 /(Co,Fe)-OH/MI was obtained and washed three times using deionized water. The mass loading of the Ir 1 /(Co,Fe)-OH/MI catalyst loaded on Ni foam was 0.70 mg cm −2 . For comparative purposes, Ir 1 /(Co,Fe)-OH, a material without MI, was synthesized. This was achieved through a simple electrodeposition method using an aqueous solution of Co 2+ /Fe 3+ /Ir 3+ . During this process, an electrodeposition potential of −1 V (versus a saturated calomel refer- ence electrode) was maintained, and the electrodeposition time was set at 240 s. In addition, samples without Ir atoms, specifically (Co,Fe)-OH/ MI and (Co,Fe)-OH, were synthesized using the above two methods. The active material average mass loadings of the (Co,Fe)-OH/MI, Ir 1 / (Co,Fe)-OH and (Co,Fe)-OH electrodes were recorded as 0.70 mg cm −2 , 0.71 mg cm −2 and 0.73 mg cm −2 , respectively. The impact of Ni foam thickness, Co/Fe ratio and Ir species’ mass fractions on the OER per- formance of Ir 1 /(Co,Fe)-OH/MI were investigated for optimization purposes (see Supplementary Figs. 56 and 57).

reasoning: 

Alright, the user wants me to act as a chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalyst and its synthesis procedure from the given paragraph. Let me break this down.

First, I need to identify what catalyst is being synthesized. The main one mentioned is Ir₁/(Co,Fe)-OH/MI. The notation suggests it's a single-atom Ir catalyst supported on a mixed cobalt-iron hydroxide layer, with "MI" likely being a metal-organic framework or similar substrate. There are also comparative catalysts without certain components - that's important context but not the primary focus.

Looking at the synthesis method, it's described as a "straightforward immersion technique" at room temperature and pressure. The key components are: cobalt nitrate, iron nitrate, and an Ir³⁺ solution dissolved in water and ethylene glycol. The pH adjustment to 4.5 using NaOH seems critical - probably for hydroxide formation. The pre-prepared Co-MI electrode immersion for 20 hours is the core step. 

Wait, I should clarify what "MI" means. From context, it's probably a pre-synthesized metal-organic framework substrate since they mention a "Co-MI electrode". The washing step with deionized water is standard purification. The mass loading on nickel foam is given as 0.70 mg/cm² - that's useful quantitative detail.

The user also mentions comparative catalysts. The Ir₁/(Co,Fe)-OH (without MI) uses electrodeposition at -1V for 240s - different method entirely. Then there are Ir-free versions made by both methods. But since the user specifically asked about the synthesized catalyst, I should focus on the main immersion-synthesized Ir₁/(Co,Fe)-OH/MI.

For the procedure summary, I'll need to present: 1) solution preparation with exact concentrations, 2) pH control, 3) immersion conditions, 4) post-treatment. The comparative catalysts can be mentioned but not detailed. The mass loading values and optimization parameters (Ni foam thickness, ratios etc.) should be included as supplementary info.

The challenge is presenting this clearly without assuming too much chemistry knowledge, while maintaining precision. The user seems to want all details preserved - so I'll include even small points like "washed three times". The ethylene glycol co-solvent role might be for solubility or morphology control, though the text doesn't specify - I'll just report what's written.

answer: 

Based on the provided paragraph, the primary catalyst synthesized is **Ir₁/(Co,Fe)-OH/MI**, where "Ir₁" indicates atomically dispersed iridium, "(Co,Fe)-OH" represents a mixed cobalt-iron hydroxide layer, and "MI" is a pre-existing substrate (likely a Metal-Organic Framework or similar structure based on the "Co-MI" designation).
