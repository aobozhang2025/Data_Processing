question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Synthesis of the Au/CeO 2 catalyst The 6Au/CeO 2 catalyst was prepared by a deposition–precipitation method 47,48 . First, ceria was synthesized by a co-precipitation method. An aqueous solution of 10 g (NH 4 ) 2 Ce(NO 3 ) 6 (Sinopharm) in 100 ml H 2 O was co-precipitated with 1 g urea (Sinopharm) at 100 °C under vigorous stirring. After boiling for 8 h, the precipitate was washed twice with hot deionized water (50–70 °C), dried for 12 h at 120 °C, crushed into powder and calcined in air at 400 °C for 10 h. Next, 1.5 ml

Methods Synthesis of Au/α-MoC and other α-MoC-based catalysts An aqueous solution (6 ml for the 6Au/α-MoC) of 9.56 g Au l -1 HAuCl 4 was added dropwise to 20 ml of 57.35 g l -1 ammonium paramolyb- date ((NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 ·4H 2 O; Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.) at 80 °C (refs. 22,33). The solution was stirred at this temperature until the complete evaporation of water. The resulting solid was crushed into powder and then dried at 120 °C overnight. To prepare the Au/MoO 3 precursor, the powder was heated to 550 °C at a rate of 10 °C min −1 in air and maintained at this temperature for 4 h. The Au/MoO 3 precur- sor was then treated in 20% CH 4 /H 2 (100 ml min −1 ) according to the following heating protocol: from 25 to 300 °C at 10 °C min −1 , from 300 to 700 °C at 1 °C min −1 , constant at 700 °C for 2 h and then cooled to room temperature. The sample was then passivated using 2% O 2 /Ar at a flow rate of 60 ml min −1 for 6 h. The Pt/α-MoC, Pd/α-MoC, Ir/α-MoC, Rh/α-MoC and Ru/α-MoC catalysts were prepared following the same procedure using different metal-containing aqueous solutions, namely H 2 PtCl 6 , PdCl 2 , IrCl 3 , RhCl 3 and RuCl 3 , respectively. The as-synthesized noble metal-containing catalyst was obtained mainly in the α-MoC 1−x phase (Extended Data Figs. 2 and 4). Pure α-MoC consisting of mainly the α-MoC 1−x phase has previously been synthesized by a tandem nitri- dation–carbonization process 22 .

Results Catalyst screening wM/α-MoC catalysts (M = Au, Pt, Pd, Ir, Rh or Ru; w denotes wt%) with dif- ferent metal contents were synthesized by temperature-programmed carbonization of wM/MoO 3 samples in 20% CH 4 /H 2 at temperatures ranging from 25 to 700 °C, followed by oxidative passivation in 2% O 2 /Ar at 25 °C for 6 h before use 22 . The performances of these catalysts in the CO-H 2 O-AHE process were evaluated in an autoclave reactor with a feed gas of CO/C 2 H 2 /Ar (6:5:89) at 3.2 MPa and 15 ml H 2 O at differ- ent temperatures (Extended Data Fig. 1). The Au/α-MoC catalyst was screened as the optimum catalyst, exhibiting a high C 2 H 2 conversion of over 99% and CO conversion of 82% with a selectivity of 83% for C 2 H 4 , 11% for CH 3 CHO and 2% for CH 3 COOH at 80 °C (Fig. 1b,d, Extended Data Fig. 1a–d and Supplementary Table 1). The yield of C 2 H 4 over the 6Au/α-MoC catalyst was nearly eight times that over the 6Pt/α-MoC and 6Pd/α-MoC catalysts, and more than 26 times that over the 6Ir/α-MoC,

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize two different catalyst preparation methods from a technical paragraph. They specifically asked for all details about what catalyst is synthesized and the step-by-step procedures. 

Hmm, looking at the text, there are actually two distinct catalysts being described - Au/CeO₂ and Au/α-MoC. The user might be comparing these two gold-based systems or just wants comprehensive documentation. I notice the Au/α-MoC part has more complete information including performance data, while Au/CeO₂ stops mid-sentence. 

As a synthetic chemist, I should pay special attention to: precursors, concentrations, temperatures, reaction times, washing/drying conditions, and any special treatments like calcination or passivation. The text uses some shorthand notation like "6Au" which means 6 wt% gold loading - important to clarify that for non-specialists. 

For Au/α-MoC, the procedure is particularly complex with multiple stages: co-evaporation, oxide precursor formation, then controlled carburization under CH₄/H₂. The slow heating rate (1°C/min!) during carburization suggests phase transformation is critical. Must highlight that. 

The user didn't specify depth level, but since they said "all details", I'll include even minor steps like crushing powders and exact gas flow rates. Performance data seems relevant too since it explains why Au/α-MoC was optimal. 

Wait - the Au/CeO₂ section cuts off at "1.5 ml". That's problematic. Should I mention the incomplete nature? Yes, but can infer from context it's probably gold precursor addition since deposition-precipitation typically follows support preparation. 

Noticing the carburization protocol is identical for all noble metals - good opportunity to show how methodology generalizes. The passivation step is easily overlooked but crucial for safety (pyrophoric materials!). 

Performance comparison table would help user see why Au/α-MoC stands out - those conversion rates are dramatic. Should emphasize the 26x superiority over Ir/Rh systems. 

User seems technical - no need to explain basic terms like "calcination" but should decode "α-MoC₁₋ₓ" phase notation. References to "Extended Data" figures can't be helped since we don't have them. 

Biggest challenge: organizing two very different syntheses clearly without mixing them up. Separate subsections with bold headers would work. Must double-check all numerical values against source text - getting the HAuCl₄ concentration right is critical. 

...Final check: did I capture every single operation? For Au/α-MoC: dropwise addition, evaporation, crushing, drying, two-stage calcination, programmed carburization, cooling, passivation. Yes. For CeO₂ support: dissolution, coprecipitation, boiling, washing, drying, crushing, calcination. Also yes. 

Performance context matters - this isn't just synthesis for its own sake, but for acetylene semi-hydrogenation. Should mention that application briefly. The exceptional low-temperature activity (80°C!) deserves emphasis.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, **two distinct catalysts** are synthesized using different procedures: **Au/CeO₂** and **Au/α-MoC** (along with other noble metal/α-MoC catalysts). Below is a detailed summary of the synthesized catalysts and their synthesis procedures:

---

### **1. Synthesis of Au/CeO₂ Catalyst (6 wt% Au)**
**Catalyst Composition:** 6 wt% Gold on Cerium Oxide (CeO₂) support.  
**Method:** Deposition-Precipitation (DP) using pre-synthesized CeO₂ support.  
**Key Steps:**

1.  **CeO₂ Support Synthesis (Co-precipitation):**
    *   Dissolve 10 g of ammonium cerium(IV) nitrate ((NH₄)₂Ce(NO₃)₆) in 100 ml deionized water.
    *   Add 1 g of urea (CO(NH₂)₂).
    *   Heat the solution to 100°C under vigorous stirring.
    *   Boil the mixture for 8 hours.
    *   Wash the resulting precipitate twice with hot deionized water (50–70°C).
    *   Dry the washed precipitate at 120°C for 12 hours.
    *   Crush the dried material into a powder.
    *   Calcinate the powder in air at 400°C for 10 hours. *Result: CeO₂ support powder.*

2.  **Gold Deposition (Incomplete in text):**
    *   The text cuts off during the DP step for Au addition ("Next, 1.5 ml"). Based on standard DP procedures for Au/CeO₂ and the context, this step would involve adding a gold precursor (e.g., HAuCl₄) to a suspension of the CeO₂ support under controlled pH/temperature to deposit Au nanoparticles. The exact details (precursor amount, pH, temperature, time) are missing from the provided excerpt.

### **2. Synthesis of Au/α-MoC Catalyst (and other M/α-MoC catalysts)**
**Catalyst Composition:** Gold (or Pt, Pd, Ir, Rh, Ru) supported on alpha-phase Molybdenum Carbide (α-MoC₁₋ₓ).  
**General Method:** Temperature-Programmed Carbonization of a Noble Metal/Molybdenum Oxide Precursor.  
**Key Steps for Au/α-MoC (6 wt% Au):**

1.  **Precursor Formation (Co-evaporation):**
    *   Prepare an aqueous solution of HAuCl₄ (9.56 g Au L⁻¹). For 6Au/α-MoC, use 6 ml of this solution.
    *   Add this HAuCl₄ solution dropwise to 20 ml of an aqueous ammonium paramolybdate solution ((NH₄)₆Mo₇O₂₄·4H₂O, 57.35 g L⁻¹) at 80°C under stirring.
    *   Continue stirring at 80°C until all water is completely evaporated.
    *   Crush the resulting solid into a powder.
    *   Dry the powder at 120°C overnight. *Result: Au/MoO₃ precursor powder.*

2.  **MoO₃ Formation (Calcination):**
    *   Heat the Au/MoO₃ precursor powder in air to 550°C at a heating rate of 10°C min⁻¹.
    *   Hold at 550°C for 4 hours. *Result: Au/MoO₃ powder.*

3.  **Carburization to α-MoC:**
    *   Place the Au/MoO₃ powder in a flow of 20% CH₄ / H₂ (100 ml min⁻¹).
    *   Heat from 25°C to 300°C at 10°C min⁻¹.
    *   Heat from 300°C to 700°C at **1°C min⁻¹** (very slow ramp critical for phase control).
    *   Hold at 700°C for 2 hours.
    *   Cool down to room temperature. *Result: Pyrophoric Au/α-MoC₁₋ₓ catalyst.*

4.  **Passivation:**
    *   Treat the cooled Au/α-MoC₁₋ₓ with a flow of 2% O₂ / Ar (60 ml min⁻¹) at room temperature for 6 hours. *Result: Stable, passivated Au/α-MoC₁₋ₓ catalyst ready for handling and use.*

**Synthesis of Other Noble Metal Catalysts (Pt, Pd, Ir, Rh, Ru/α-MoC):**
*   Follow the **exact same procedure** as for Au/α-MoC.
*   Replace the HAuCl₄ solution with equivalent solutions of:
    *   H₂PtCl₆ (for Pt/α-MoC)
    *   PdCl₂ (for Pd/α-MoC)
    *   IrCl₃ (for Ir/α-MoC)
    *   RhCl₃ (for Rh/α-MoC)
    *   RuCl₃ (for Ru/α-MoC)
*   The resulting catalysts are primarily in the α-MoC₁₋ₓ phase.

### **Performance Context (for wM/α-MoC Catalysts)**
*   These catalysts (wM/α-MoC, M = Au, Pt, Pd, Ir, Rh, Ru; w = wt% metal loading) were screened for the CO-H₂O Assisted Hydrogenation of Ethyne (CO-H₂O-AHE) process.
*   **Au/α-MoC (specifically 6Au/α-MoC) was identified as the optimum catalyst:**
    *   Reaction: Feed gas CO/C₂H₂/Ar (6:5:89), 3.2 MPa, 15 ml H₂O.
    *   Performance at 80°C:
        *   C₂H₂ Conversion: >99%
        *   CO Conversion: 82%
        *   Selectivity: 83% C₂H₄, 11% CH₃CHO, 2% CH₃COOH
    *   The C₂H₄ yield over 6Au/α-MoC was ~8x higher than over 6Pt/α-MoC or 6Pd/α-MoC, and >26x higher than over 6Ir/α-MoC, 6Rh/α-MoC, or 6Ru/α-MoC.

### Key Synthesis Observations
*   **Au/CeO₂:** Focuses on meticulous CeO₂ support synthesis via urea co-precipitation/calcination. Gold deposition details are incomplete in the provided text.
*   **Au/α-MoC (and analogues):** Relies on forming a well-mixed noble metal/molybdate precursor via co-evaporation, converting it to the oxide (MoO₃), and then carefully carburizing it under CH₄/H₂ with an extremely slow heating ramp (1°C/min) between 300-700°C to achieve the active α-MoC₁₋ₓ phase. Passivation is essential for safety.
*   **Phase:** The critical support phase for the high-performance catalyst is α-MoC₁₋ₓ.
