question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Materials synthesis. Pb 1 Cu SAA catalyst. First, the Cu–Pb precursor was synthesized using an epoxide gelation approach. First, 515 mg CuCl 2 ·2H 2 O and 115 mg Pb(NO 3 ) 2 were dissolved in 2 ml isopropanol in a vial. Under bath sonication, 2 ml propylene oxide and 0.2 ml H 2 O were then successively added, forming a green gel. The green gel was aged for 1 day and dried at 60 °C under vacuum overnight. The Pb 1 Cu SAA catalyst was then formed in situ by reducing the Cu–Pb precursor at a constant current density of −500 mA cm−2 for 30 min in a standard three-electrode flow cell system supplied with CO 2 gas, with 0.5 M KHCO 3 as electrolyte.

Cu, Pb and Pb@Cu particles. Cu and Pb nanoparticles were synthesized in an approach similar to that used for the Pb 1 Cu SAA catalyst, except that 515 mg CuCl 2 ·2H 2 O or 500 mg Pb(NO 3 ) 2 , respectively, was used. To synthesize the Pb@Cu particles, 5 ml of a 10 mM Pb(NO 3 ) 2 solution was added to a suspension of 50 mg Cu nanoparticles in 15 ml of H 2 O with constant stirring, followed by the dropwise addition of a 50 mM NaBH 4 solution. This reaction was conducted for 1 h.

Bi 1 Cu and In 1 Cu SAAs. Bi 1 Cu and In 1 Cu SAAs were synthesized in a similar approach to that used for the Pb 1 Cu SAA, except that Pb(NO 3 ) 2 was replaced with 170 mg Bi(NO 3 ) 3 ·5H 2 O or 96 mg In(NO 3 ) 3 ·5H 2 O, respectively.

reasoning: 

Alright, the user wants me to act as a chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalysts and procedures from a given paragraph. Let me start by breaking down the text section by section.

First, the Pb₁Cu SAA catalyst. The synthesis starts with an epoxide gelation method. They dissolve CuCl₂·2H₂O and Pb(NO₃)₂ in isopropanol, then add propylene oxide and water under sonication to form a green gel. After aging and drying, they reduce the precursor electrochemically in a flow cell with CO₂ and KHCO₃ electrolyte. I need to note the specific amounts and conditions here—515 mg Cu salt, 115 mg Pb salt, aging time, drying temp, and reduction current density and duration.

Next, they mention control samples: Cu and Pb nanoparticles. These are made similarly but using only one metal salt each. The Pb@Cu particles are different. They take pre-made Cu nanoparticles, add Pb(NO₃)₂ solution, then reduce with NaBH₄. The user might need these controls for comparison, so I should highlight the difference in synthesis methods.

Then there are Bi₁Cu and In₁Cu SAAs. The procedure is like Pb₁Cu but with different salts: Bi(NO₃)₃·5H₂O or In(NO₃)₃·5H₂O. Quantities are 170 mg and 96 mg respectively. Here, consistency in the synthesis approach is key, so pointing out the replacements makes sense.

Now, considering the user's deeper needs. They might be a researcher or student replicating the synthesis. They need clear, step-by-step details without ambiguity. The mention of SAAs suggests interest in single-atom alloys for catalysis, possibly for CO₂ reduction. The controls indicate the need for benchmarking. I should ensure all parameters are explicit, like concentrations, volumes, and reaction times. Also, clarifying terms like "in situ" reduction and "epoxide gelation" helps those less familiar. Highlighting the electrochemical setup with CO₂ flow is crucial since it's part of the catalyst formation. They might also be comparing different metal combinations, so structuring each catalyst section separately aids readability. Accuracy in translating masses and conditions is vital for reproducibility. I should check if all catalysts are covered and no steps are omitted, like the drying under vacuum. Finally, emphasizing the SAA structure formation during reduction ties the synthesis to the catalyst's function.

Based on the provided text, here is a professional chemist's summary of the catalysts synthesized and their detailed synthesis procedures:

**Synthesized Catalysts:**

1.  **Pb₁Cu Single-Atom Alloy (SAA):** Lead atoms atomically dispersed in a copper host matrix.
2.  **Cu Nanoparticles (Control):** Pure copper nanoparticles.
3.  **Pb Nanoparticles (Control):** Pure lead nanoparticles.
4.  **Pb@Cu Core-Shell Particles:** Lead shells deposited onto pre-formed copper nanoparticle cores.
5.  **Bi₁Cu Single-Atom Alloy (SAA):** Bismuth atoms atomically dispersed in a copper host matrix.
6.  **In₁Cu Single-Atom Alloy (SAA):** Indium atoms atomically dispersed in a copper host matrix.

**Detailed Synthesis Procedures:**

1.  **Pb₁Cu SAA, Bi₁Cu SAA, and In₁Cu SAA (Shared Epoxide Gelation + Electroreduction Method):**
    *   **Precursor Gel Synthesis:**
        *   Dissolve metal salts in 2 ml isopropanol within a vial.
            *   *Pb₁Cu:* 515 mg CuCl₂·2H₂O + 115 mg Pb(NO₃)₂
            *   *Bi₁Cu:* 515 mg CuCl₂·2H₂O + 170 mg Bi(NO₃)₃·5H₂O
            *   *In₁Cu:* 515 mg CuCl₂·2H₂O + 96 mg In(NO₃)₃·5H₂O
        *   Under bath sonication, add **2 ml propylene oxide** followed by **0.2 ml H₂O**.
        *   A colored gel forms (green for Pb/Cu).
    *   **Gel Processing:**
        *   Age the gel at room temperature for **1 day**.
        *   Dry the aged gel under vacuum at **60 °C overnight**.
    *   **Catalyst Formation (In situ Electroreduction):**
        *   Use the dried precursor as the working electrode in a standard **three-electrode flow cell**.
        *   Electrolyte: **0.5 M KHCO₃** aqueous solution.
        *   Feed gas: **CO₂** (flowing).
        *   Apply a constant cathodic current density of **-500 mA cm⁻²** for **30 minutes**. This electrochemical reduction transforms the precursor into the active SAA catalyst.

2.  **Cu Nanoparticles and Pb Nanoparticles (Control Samples - Modified Epoxide Gelation):**
    *   Follow the *exact* "Precursor Gel Synthesis" and "Gel Processing" steps described for the SAAs (using 2 ml isopropanol, adding 2 ml propylene oxide + 0.2 ml H₂O under sonication, aging 1 day, drying at 60°C under vacuum overnight), **BUT**:
        *   For **Cu NPs:** Use **only 515 mg CuCl₂·2H₂O** (omit the second metal salt).
        *   For **Pb NPs:** Use **only 500 mg Pb(NO₃)₂** (omit CuCl₂·2H₂O, note slightly different mass than in Pb₁Cu).
    *   *No subsequent electroreduction step is mentioned for these controls.* The dried gel *is* the nanoparticle material.

3.  **Pb@Cu Core-Shell Particles (Wet Chemical Deposition):**
    *   Prepare a suspension of pre-synthesized **Cu nanoparticles (50 mg)** in **15 ml H₂O** with constant stirring.
    *   Add **5 ml of a 10 mM Pb(NO₃)₂ aqueous solution** to the stirring Cu NP suspension.
    *   Add a **50 mM NaBH₄ aqueous solution dropwise** to the mixture. (Volume of NaBH₄ solution not specified).
    *   Continue the reaction with stirring for **1 hour**. This chemically reduces the Pb²⁺ onto the Cu NP surfaces, forming the core-shell structure.

**Key Synthesis Features:**

*   **SAA & Pure NP Precursors:** Utilize an **epoxide (propylene oxide) gelation method** in isopropanol/water to form mixed-metal or single-metal oxide/hydroxide/chloride gels.
