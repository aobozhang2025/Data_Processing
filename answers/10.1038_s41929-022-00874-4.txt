question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Preparation of CoCZ by strong electrostatic adsorption A series of CZ-based catalysts with different metal loadings were prepared using a wet impregnation method 14 . For this purpose, the desired amount of cobalt acetate was dissolved in 50 ml of deionized water. The suspension obtained by the addition of 2 g of nanocrys- talline CZ was stirred for 2 h, followed by removal of water by evap- oration. Catalysts were dried at 110 °C in air overnight and then calcined at 350 °C for 4 h. Before catalytic activity tests, catalysts were reduced at 225–500 °C in H 2 for 4 h. Catalysts reduced at differ- ent temperatures are denoted as xCoy, where x is Co loading and y reduction temperature.

Sol-gel synthesis of single-atom CoCZ To obtain a solid solution of CoCZ (Co-doped CZ solid solution), a synthesis procedure reported by Yuan et al. 42 was modified. In a typical synthesis, 0.8 g of Pluronic P123 (Sigma-Aldrich) and the desired ratio of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 ⋅ 6H 2 O (Sigma-Aldrich), ZrOCl 2 ⋅ 8H 2 O (Sigma-Aldrich) and Co(NO 3 ) 2 ⋅ 6H 2 O (total amount of Co, Ce and Zr was 5 mmol) were added to 16 ml of ethanol. After stirring for at least 2 h at room temperature, the homogeneous sol was transferred to an oven at 40 °C. After 48 h of ageing, the gel product was dried at 100 °C for 24 h. Calcination was carried out in air by slowly increasing the temperature from room temperature to 500 °C at a rate of 1 °C min −1 , followed by a dwell of 4 h at 500 °C.

Cobalt nanoparticles supported on SiO 2 Small cobalt nanoparticles were synthesized using wetness impreg- nation with a cobalt (tris)ethyleneamine precursor. Catalysts were dried at 110 °C in air overnight and then pyrolysed in a helium flow at 350 °C for 4 h. Before catalytic activity tests, catalysts were reduced at 300–500 °C in H 2 for 4 h.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to summarize catalyst synthesis procedures from a technical paragraph. They specifically asked me to imagine being a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis. 

First, I need to identify all catalysts described: CoCZ via SEA, single-atom CoCZ via sol-gel, and Co/SiO₂ nanoparticles. The user emphasized wanting "all details", so I must extract every parameter - precursors, concentrations, temperatures, durations etc.

For the SEA method: It's classic wet impregnation but with electrostatic control. Key details include cobalt acetate precursor, 50ml water volume, 2g CZ support, 2h stirring, evaporation drying. Post-treatment is crucial too - 110°C drying, 350°C calcination, and variable reduction (225-500°C). Naming convention "xCoy" is operational important.

The sol-gel synthesis is more complex. Modified Yuan procedure with P123 template. Molar ratios matter - total metals fixed at 5mmol. Ethanol solvent (16ml), 2h stirring RT, then slow gelation at 40°C/48h. Calcination ramp (1°C/min to 500°C) is critical for solid solution formation. 

Co/SiO₂ uses specialty precursor - cobalt tris(ethyleneamine). Pyrolysis in He at 350°C differs from calcination. Reduction range narrower (300-500°C). Should note absence of specific SiO₂ amount.

User probably needs this for lab replication or comparison study. Might be evaluating synthesis methods for catalytic properties. I'll structure by catalyst type, preserve all numerical values, and highlight distinguishing features like SEA vs sol-gel approaches. The naming conventions and precursor choices are particularly significant for reproducibility.
