question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Sample preparation. Both The single-atom Pt1/FeOx catalyst (denoted as sample A, with a Pt/Fe atomic ratio of 1/1430 and a Pt loading of 0.17  weight percent (wt%)) and a similar catalyst with a Pt loading of 2.5 wt% (denoted as sample B, with a Pt/Fe atomic ratio of 1/95) were prepared by co-precipitation of an aqueous solution of chloroplatinic acid (H 2 PtCl 6 . 6H 2 O, 7.59 × 10 22 mol l 21 ) and ferric nitrate (Fe(NO 3 ) 3 . 9H 2 O, 1 mol l 21 ) with sodium carbonate (Na 2 CO 3 , 1 mol l 21 ) at 50 8C, with the pH value of the resulting solution controlled at about 8. The recovered solid was dried at 60 8C for five hours and calcined at 400 8C for five hours. Prior to being characterized and tested, the samples were reduced in 10% H 2 /He at 200 8C for 0.5 hours. The actual Pt loadings in the two samples, determined by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy on an IRIS Intrepid II XSP instrument (Thermo Electron Corporation), were 0.17 wt% for sample A and 2.50 wt% for sample B.

reasoning: 

Alright, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis. They provided a paragraph describing the preparation of two platinum-on-iron oxide catalysts and need me to extract all the details. 

First, I need to identify exactly what catalysts are being made. The text mentions two samples: sample A with ultra-low Pt loading (0.17 wt%, Pt/Fe=1/1430) and sample B with higher loading (2.5 wt%, Pt/Fe=1/95). Both are single-atom Pt catalysts on FeOx support. That's interesting - single-atom catalysts are hot topics in catalysis research due to their maximized atomic efficiency.

Looking at the synthesis procedure, it's a co-precipitation method. The precursors are clearly specified: chloroplatinic acid for Pt and ferric nitrate for Fe, with sodium carbonate as precipitating agent. The concentrations are given precisely - I should make sure to include those molarities. The reaction conditions matter too: 50°C temperature and pH controlled at 8. 

The post-precipitation steps are equally important. Drying at 60°C for 5 hours seems gentle, probably to preserve the precipitate structure. Then calcination at 400°C for 5 hours - that's where the oxide support forms. Finally, the pre-test reduction in 10% H2/He at 200°C for 30 minutes activates the catalyst by reducing Pt species. 

I notice the actual loadings were verified by ICP-OES. That's good lab practice - always confirm theoretical loadings with analytical data. The instrument details (Thermo Electron's IRIS Intrepid II XSP) might be relevant for reproducibility. 

The user seems to need this for academic or industrial research. Maybe they're replicating the synthesis or designing similar catalysts. I should present the information systematically: catalyst specs first, then step-by-step procedure with all parameters, and finally characterization details. No assumptions - every number from the text must be included. 

Hmm, I wonder if they'll ask about why certain conditions were chosen. Like why pH 8? Or why 400°C calcination? But since they only asked for summary, I'll stick to factual extraction. Better double-check I didn't miss any numbers - yes, got the H2PtCl6 concentration (7.59×10²² mol/L? That can't be right... *checks* Ah, typo in original, probably meant 7.59×10⁻³ mol/L based on context). Will note that uncertainty but preserve original notation.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here is a professional chemist's summary of the synthesized catalyst and its detailed synthesis procedure:

**Synthesized Catalyst:**
1.  **Type:** Single-atom Pt catalyst supported on FeOx (Iron Oxide).
2.  **Samples:**
    *   **Sample A:** Pt loading = 0.17 wt%, Pt/Fe atomic ratio = 1/1430
    *   **Sample B:** Pt loading = 2.5 wt%, Pt/Fe atomic ratio = 1/95
3.  **Key Feature:** Pt is present as single atoms dispersed on the FeOx support.

**Detailed Synthesis Procedure:**

1.  **Precursor Solutions:**
    *   Prepare an aqueous solution of **Chloroplatinic Acid** (H₂PtCl₆·6H₂O) at a concentration of **7.59 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹** (Note: Original text likely has a typo; 7.59 × 10²² mol L⁻¹ is implausible. 7.59 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹ is standard for such syntheses).
    *   Prepare an aqueous solution of **Ferric Nitrate** (Fe(NO₃)₃·9H₂O) at a concentration of **1 mol L⁻¹**.
    *   Prepare an aqueous solution of **Sodium Carbonate** (Na₂CO₃) at a concentration of **1 mol L⁻¹**.

2.  **Co-precipitation:**
    *   Co-precipitate the Pt and Fe precursors by adding the **sodium carbonate solution** to the **mixed aqueous solution of chloroplatinic acid and ferric nitrate**.
    *   Perform precipitation at a constant temperature of **50 °C**.
    *   Strictly control the pH of the resulting mixture/slurry at **approximately 8** during precipitation.
    *   The *relative amounts* of the Pt and Fe precursor solutions determine the final Pt loading and Pt/Fe ratio (Sample A: low Pt, Sample B: high Pt).

3.  **Solid Recovery:**
    *   Filter or centrifuge the suspension to **recover the solid precipitate**.

4.  **Drying:**
    *   Dry the recovered solid at **60 °C** for **5 hours**.

5.  **Calcination:**
    *   Heat the dried solid (calcine) in an oven/furnace at **400 °C** for **5 hours** (typically in air). This converts the precursor mixture into the oxide support (FeOx) and stabilizes the Pt species.

6.  **Pre-Test Reduction (Activation):**
    *   Prior to characterization or catalytic testing, activate the catalyst by reduction.
    *   Reduce the calcined samples in a flowing gas mixture of **10% H₂ / He (balance)**.
    *   Reduction temperature: **200 °C**.
    *   Reduction time: **0.5 hours (30 minutes)**.

**Characterization Confirmation:**
*   The actual Pt loadings in the final catalysts were confirmed using **Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES)**.
*   Instrument used: **IRIS Intrepid II XSP instrument (Thermo Electron Corporation)**.
*   Measured Loadings:
    *   Sample A: **0.17 wt% Pt**
    *   Sample B: **2.50 wt% Pt** (confirming the target loadings).
