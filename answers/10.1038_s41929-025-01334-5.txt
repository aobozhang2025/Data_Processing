question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Catalyst preparation A series of xFe–yMn catalysts, with different Fe/Mn molar ratios, was prepared via the co-precipitation method using iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO 3 ) 3 ·9H 2 O) and manganese(II) nitrate tetrahy- drate (Mn(NO 3 ) 2 ·4H 2 O) as the metal precursors. Typically, appropri- ate amounts of Fe(NO 3 ) 3 ·9H 2 O and Mn(NO 3 ) 2 ·4H 2 O were dissolved in deionized water (180 ml) for a total molar concentration of Fe 3+ and Mn 2+ of 0.56 mol l −1 . Each mass of Fe(NO 3 ) 3 ·9H 2 O and Mn(NO 3 ) 2 ·4H 2 O was determined by the molar ratio of Fe to Mn (9.9:0.1, 9.5:0.5, 9:1, 7:3 and 5:5). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. Then, ammonia solution (NH 4 OH; Roth, 25% NH 3 in H 2 O) was added dropwise into the above solution under stirring until the pH value reached 9.5. The suspension was aged for 3 h, filtered and washed until a neutral pH value was achieved. The obtained samples were dried at 100 °C overnight and calcined at 400 °C with a heating rate of 3 °C min −1 for 6 h. They were named xFe–yMn, where x:y stands for the molar ratio of Fe to Mn. The catalyst without Mn was also prepared using only Fe(NO 3 ) 3 ꞏ9H 2 O while other preparation conditions were kept the same.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalyst details and synthesis procedure from a given paragraph. Let me carefully analyze this technical text.

First, I need to identify the catalyst being synthesized - it's a series of iron-manganese mixed oxide catalysts with varying Fe/Mn molar ratios. The naming convention is xFe-yMn where x:y represents the Fe:Mn molar ratio. They also prepared a pure iron oxide catalyst as reference.

Looking at the synthesis method, it's clearly a co-precipitation procedure. The precursors are iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate and manganese(II) nitrate tetrahydrate dissolved in deionized water. The total metal concentration is fixed at 0.56 mol/L while the ratios vary across five compositions: 9.9:0.1, 9.5:0.5, 9:1, 7:3, and 5:5 Fe:Mn.

The precipitation step uses ammonia solution added dropwise until pH 9.5 is reached. Important details include the aging time (3 hours), thorough washing to neutral pH, and specific thermal treatment - drying at 100°C overnight followed by calcination at 400°C with controlled heating rate (3°C/min) for 6 hours.

I should highlight the controlled precipitation conditions since pH and aging affect catalyst properties. The thermal treatment details are crucial too - calcination temperature and ramp rate influence oxide phase formation. The user is likely a researcher needing precise replication, so I'll ensure all parameters are clearly presented: volumes, concentrations, temperatures, times.

The pure Fe catalyst preparation is mentioned as control, which helps benchmark Mn's effect. I'll structure the summary logically: catalyst composition first, then step-by-step procedure with all technical specs. Professional terminology like "metal precursors" and "co-precipitation" should be maintained while keeping it accessible.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here is a professional summary of the catalyst synthesized and its detailed synthesis procedure:

**Catalyst Synthesized:**
*   **Type:** A series of iron-manganese mixed oxide catalysts.
*   **Composition:** Varying Fe/Mn molar ratios (x:y).
*   **Nomenclature:** Named **xFe-yMn**, where `x` and `y` represent the molar ratio of Fe to Mn (e.g., 9.9Fe-0.1Mn, 9.5Fe-0.5Mn, 9Fe-1Mn, 7Fe-3Mn, 5Fe-5Mn).
*   **Control Catalyst:** A pure iron oxide catalyst (no Mn) was also prepared under identical conditions for comparison.
*   **Form:** Calcined mixed metal oxides.

**Synthesis Procedure (Co-precipitation Method):**

1.  **Precursor Solution Preparation:**
    *   Dissolve appropriate masses of **Iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO₃)₃·9H₂O)** and **Manganese(II) nitrate tetrahydrate (Mn(NO₃)₂·4H₂O)** in **180 ml deionized water**.
    *   The masses are calculated to achieve:
        *   A **total molar concentration of Fe³⁺ + Mn²⁺ = 0.56 mol L⁻¹**.
        *   Specific **Fe:Mn molar ratios**: 9.9:0.1, 9.5:0.5, 9:1, 7:3, 5:5. (For the control, use only Fe(NO₃)₃·9H₂O).
    *   Stir the resulting solution at **room temperature (RT) for 1 hour**.

2.  **Co-precipitation:**
    *   Under continuous stirring, add **Ammonia solution (NH₄OH, 25% NH₃ in H₂O)** **dropwise** to the metal nitrate solution.
    *   Continue adding ammonia until the **pH reaches 9.5**.

3.  **Aging:**
    *   Maintain the resulting suspension (containing the precipitated hydroxides/oxides) at the achieved pH **for 3 hours**.

4.  **Filtration and Washing:**
    *   Filter the aged suspension to collect the solid precipitate.
    *   Wash the precipitate thoroughly with deionized water **until the washings reach a neutral pH (pH ~7)**.

5.  **Drying:**
    *   Dry the washed solid **at 100 °C overnight**.

6.  **Calcination:**
    *   Heat the dried sample in a furnace under air/oxidizing atmosphere to **400 °C**.
    *   Use a **heating rate of 3 °C min⁻¹**.
    *   Hold at **400 °C for 6 hours**.

**Key Synthesis Details:**
*   **Method:** Co-precipitation.
*   **Precursors:** Fe(NO₃)₃·9H₂O, Mn(NO₃)₂·4H₂O.
*   **Precipitating Agent:** NH₄OH solution (25% NH₃).
*   **Target Precipitation pH:** 9.5.
*   **Aging Time:** 3 hours at pH 9.5.
*   **Washing Endpoint:** Neutral pH (pH ~7).
*   **Drying:** 100 °C, overnight (~12-24 hours).
*   **Calcination:** 400 °C for 6 hours, ramp rate 3 °C min⁻¹.

This procedure produces a series of calcined Fe-Mn-O mixed oxide catalysts with controlled stoichiometry (xFe-yMn) and a pure Fe-O reference catalyst.
