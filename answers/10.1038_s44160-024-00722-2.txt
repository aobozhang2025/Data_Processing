question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Commercial carbon black (1 g, Vulcan XC-72R, Fuel Cell Store) was first oxidized in a three-neck flask with nitric acid (10 M, 200 ml). Afterwards, under well-dispersed stirring conditions, the temperature was fixed at 90 °C for 12 h with a reflux system. After oxidation, the slurry was taken out, centrifuged and washed with deionized water and ethanol twice until the solution pH reached neutral. The sample was dried at 70 °C in a vacuum oven, and the resulting oxidized carbon black sample was denoted as C(O). One-hundred milligrams of the as-obtained C(O) was dispersed in 100 ml of Millipore-filtered water by tip sonication for 1 h to prepare a homogeneous dispersion. Then, 5 ml of InCl2, SnCl4 and SbCl3 glycol solution (0.5 mg ml−1) were added dropwise into carbon black dispersion under vigorous stirring for 12 h. Then, the mixture was frozen  quickly and entirely using liquid nitrogen. The mixed ice was melted at room temperature after irradiation by Xe lamp (>420 nm). The powder, obtained by rinsing and centrifuging with deionized water and ethanol, was dried at 60 °C in the vacuum oven for 12 h to obtain the In1/C(O), Sn1/C(O) and Sb1/C(O). As a comparison, Sn1/C was prepared using the carbon black as support.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalyst and its synthesis procedure from the given paragraph. Let me carefully analyze this technical text.

First, I need to identify what catalyst is being synthesized. The paragraph mentions "In1/C(O)", "Sn1/C(O)", "Sb1/C(O)", and "Sn1/C" as final products. These appear to be metal-doped catalysts supported on carbon black. The "(O)" notation clearly indicates oxidized carbon support.

Looking at the synthesis procedure, it involves two main stages: support preparation and metal deposition. For support prep, they start with commercial Vulcan XC-72R carbon black, oxidize it with nitric acid at 90°C for 12 hours under reflux. This functionalizes the carbon surface. Then thorough washing and drying at 70°C under vacuum yields C(O).

The metal deposition part is interesting. They use tip sonication to disperse C(O) in water, then add glycol solutions of InCl₂, SnCl₄, or SbCl₃ dropwise. The "1" in catalyst names suggests about 1 wt% metal loading based on the 100mg support to 5ml of 0.5mg/ml solution ratio. 

The unique step is the liquid nitrogen freezing followed by Xe lamp (>420nm) irradiation during thawing. This photo-assisted deposition is likely key to metal reduction/anchoring. Finally, washing and vacuum drying at 60°C completes the synthesis.

The control sample Sn1/C uses untreated carbon, highlighting the importance of oxidation pretreatment. I should emphasize this comparison in my summary.

The user seems knowledgeable about chemistry based on how they framed the question - probably a researcher or student needing precise technical details. I'll maintain professional terminology while ensuring clarity about each synthesis step and the rationale behind key procedures like oxidation and photo-irradiation.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here's a professional summary of the synthesized catalyst and its detailed synthesis procedure:

1.  **Catalyst Synthesized:**
    *   **Primary Catalysts:** Metal nanoparticles (Indium, Tin, or Antimony) supported on **oxidized carbon black (C(O))**.
        *   `In1/C(O)`: ~1 wt% Indium on oxidized Vulcan XC-72R.
        *   `Sn1/C(O)`: ~1 wt% Tin on oxidized Vulcan XC-72R.
        *   `Sb1/C(O)`: ~1 wt% Antimony on oxidized Vulcan XC-72R.
    *   **Control Catalyst:** Tin nanoparticles supported on **unoxidized carbon black**.
        *   `Sn1/C`: ~1 wt% Tin on untreated Vulcan XC-72R.
    *   **Support Material:** Vulcan XC-72R carbon black (Fuel Cell Store).
    *   **Key Feature:** The carbon support is deliberately oxidized (`C(O)`) prior to metal deposition for the primary catalysts, introducing oxygen functional groups to anchor metal precursors.

2.  **Detailed Synthesis Procedure:**

    **Stage 1: Support Oxidation & Preparation (Synthesis of C(O))**
    1.  **Oxidation:** 1 g of Vulcan XC-72R carbon black is placed in a three-neck flask. 200 ml of 10 M Nitric Acid (HNO₃) is added.
    2.  **Reaction:** The mixture is stirred well and heated to 90 °C under reflux for 12 hours.
    3.  **Workup:**
        *   The resulting slurry is removed from the flask.
        *   It is centrifuged to separate the solid.
        *   The solid is washed repeatedly with deionized (DI) water and ethanol (twice each wash cycle) until the washings are pH neutral.
    4.  **Drying:** The washed solid is dried in a vacuum oven at 70 °C. This final product is labeled **C(O)** (oxidized carbon black).

    **Stage 2: Metal Deposition (Synthesis of M1/C(O) & Sn1/C)**
    5.  **Support Dispersion:** 100 mg of the dried C(O) is dispersed in 100 ml of Millipore-filtered water using tip sonication for 1 hour to create a homogeneous dispersion. *(For Sn1/C, unoxidized Vulcan XC-72R is used instead of C(O) in this step).*
    6.  **Precursor Addition:** 5 ml of a specific metal chloride glycol solution (InCl₂, SnCl₄, or SbCl₃; each solution at 0.5 mg metal per ml) is added **dropwise** to the carbon dispersion under **vigorous stirring**.
    7.  **Impregnation:** Stirring is continued for 12 hours after precursor addition is complete to allow interaction/adsorption.
    8.  **Photo-Assisted Deposition/Reduction:**
        *   The entire mixture is rapidly frozen using liquid nitrogen.
        *   The frozen mixture is thawed at room temperature while being irradiated with a Xe lamp equipped with a filter (λ > 420 nm). This light assists in reducing the metal ions and anchoring them onto the support.
    9.  **Workup:**
        *   The resulting solid is separated by centrifugation.
        *   It is rinsed (washed) repeatedly with DI water and ethanol.
    10. **Drying:** The washed solid is dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 hours. This yields the final catalysts: **In1/C(O)**, **Sn1/C(O)**, **Sb1/C(O)**, or the control **Sn1/C**.

**Key Synthesis Features:**

*   **Support Functionalization:** HNO₃ oxidation creates oxygen groups (carboxylic, hydroxyl, carbonyl) on the carbon black surface (`C(O)`), crucial for anchoring metal precursors.
*   **Metal Loading:** ~1 wt% metal loading is achieved (100 mg support + 5 ml * 0.5 mg/ml metal solution = 2.5 mg metal).
*   **Deposition Mechanism:** Combines wet impregnation (stirring) with a unique **photo-assisted freezing-thawing method** (Liquid N₂ freeze + Thawing under >420 nm light) likely to promote reduction and nanoparticle formation/stabilization.
*   **Control:** `Sn1/C` highlights the effect of support oxidation by using pristine carbon black.

This procedure synthesizes a series of low-loading metal nanoparticle catalysts supported on functionalized carbon black, utilizing a photo-assisted freezing-thawing step for metal deposition.
