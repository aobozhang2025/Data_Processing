question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Synthesis of M–NHGFs. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise specified. Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized by oxidation of natural graphite flakes (100 mesh) following a modified Hummers’ method61. The M–NHGFs (M = Fe, Co, Ni) were synthesized using a two-step process. In a typical procedure for synthesizing Ni–NHGF, 50 µ l of 3 mg ml–1 NiCl 2 · 6H 2 O and 15 µ l of 30% H 2 O 2 were added into 10 ml of 2 mg ml–1 GO suspension and sonicated for 1 h. The mixed suspension was hydrothermally treated at 180 °C for 6 h, forming a porous hydrogel. After freeze drying, the gel was placed in the center of 1-inch quartz tube furnace and annealed at 900 °C for 1 h with flows of Ar (100 sccm) and NH 3 (50 sccm) to obtain Ni–NHGF. As control samples, non-holey Ni–NGF was prepared without the addition of H 2 O 2 during the hydrothermal process and metal-free NHGF was prepared without the addition of Ni precursor. Fe–NHGF and Co–NHGF were prepared by the same procedure but changing the metal precursor to 2 mg ml–1 FeCl 3 and 3 mg ml–1 CoCl 2 · 6H 2 O, respectively.


reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to summarize the catalyst synthesis described in a technical paragraph. They specifically asked for all details about what catalyst is made and the step-by-step procedure. 

Hmm, I notice this is about metal-doped holey nitrogen-doped graphene frameworks (M–NHGFs). The paragraph contains very precise measurements and conditions - I should be meticulous in extracting every parameter. The user is role-playing as a chemist, so they likely need this for replication or reference.

Looking at the text, there are three key catalysts: Ni–NHGF as the main example, plus Fe–NHGF and Co–NHGF variants. The synthesis has two distinct phases: hydrothermal treatment followed by annealing. Interesting that H₂O₂ creates the "holey" structure - that's a critical detail the user might care about for catalytic surface area.

For the procedure, I'll need to capture exact volumes (like 50 µl of NiCl₂), concentrations (3 mg/ml), and process conditions (180°C for 6h hydrothermal). The annealing atmosphere is particularly important - that Ar/NH₃ mix enables nitrogen doping. Should also mention the control samples since they highlight what makes NHGFs unique.

The user didn't ask about applications, but as a catalyst specialist, I wonder if they're testing these for reactions like ORR. Maybe they'll follow up. For now, strict adherence to summarizing the synthesis is key - no extrapolation. 

Noting the metal precursor differences for Fe/Co variants: FeCl₃ at 2 mg/ml vs CoCl₂ at 3 mg/ml. Must preserve these specifics. Freeze-drying step is easy to overlook but essential for preserving the hydrogel structure. 

Control samples are clever - shows the team isolated variables (H₂O₂ for holes, metal for doping). Should explain their purpose briefly since it clarifies the catalyst's composition. 

Final output needs bulletproof accuracy. Will double-check every number against the paragraph. No assumptions - if it's not stated (like heating ramp rate), I won't invent it. User clearly wants lab-manual level precision.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here's a professional chemist's summary of the synthesized catalysts and their detailed synthesis procedure:

**Synthesized Catalysts:**
1.  **Ni–NHGF:** Nickel-doped Holey Nitrogen-doped Graphene Framework (primary example).
2.  **Fe–NHGF:** Iron-doped Holey Nitrogen-doped Graphene Framework.
3.  **Co–NHGF:** Cobalt-doped Holey Nitrogen-doped Graphene Framework.
4.  **Control Samples:**
    *   **non-holey Ni–NGF:** Nickel-doped *Non-holey* Nitrogen-doped Graphene Framework.
    *   **metal-free NHGF:** Metal-free Holey Nitrogen-doped Graphene Framework.

**Detailed Synthesis Procedure (Exemplified for Ni–NHGF):**

1.  **Graphene Oxide (GO) Precursor:**
    *   Synthesized from natural graphite flakes (100 mesh) using a modified Hummers' method (Ref 61).
    *   A 2 mg ml⁻¹ aqueous suspension of this GO was used.

2.  **Hydrothermal Gel Formation:**
    *   To 10 ml of the 2 mg ml⁻¹ GO suspension, add:
        *   50 µl of 3 mg ml⁻¹ NiCl₂·6H₂O solution (Nickel precursor).
        *   15 µl of 30% H₂O₂ solution (Hole-forming agent).
    *   Sonicate the resulting mixture for 1 hour to ensure homogeneity.
    *   Transfer the mixture to a hydrothermal reactor (e.g., Teflon-lined autoclave).
    *   Hydrothermally treat the mixture at **180 °C for 6 hours**.
    *   **Result:** Formation of a porous hydrogel (Ni/GO hydrogel).

3.  **Freeze-Drying:**
    *   Subject the obtained porous hydrogel to freeze-drying (lyophilization).
    *   **Result:** Removal of water to yield a dried aerogel-like structure, preserving the porous morphology.

4.  **Thermal Annealing & Doping:**
    *   Place the freeze-dried gel in the center of a 1-inch diameter quartz tube furnace.
    *   Anneal the material at **900 °C for 1 hour** under a flowing gas mixture:
        *   Argon (Ar): 100 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm).
        *   Ammonia (NH₃): 50 sccm.
    *   **Result:** Thermal reduction of GO, simultaneous nitrogen doping (from NH₃ decomposition), and graphitization, yielding the final **Ni–NHGF** catalyst.

**Variations for Other Catalysts:**

1.  **Fe–NHGF:**
    *   Replace the Ni precursor with **2 mg ml⁻¹ FeCl₃** solution.
    *   Keep all other steps, volumes, concentrations (H₂O₂, GO), and conditions (sonication time, hydrothermal T/t, freeze-drying, annealing T/t/gas flows) identical to the Ni–NHGF procedure.

2.  **Co–NHGF:**
    *   Replace the Ni precursor with **3 mg ml⁻¹ CoCl₂·6H₂O** solution.
    *   Keep all other steps, volumes, concentrations (H₂O₂, GO), and conditions (sonication time, hydrothermal T/t, freeze-drying, annealing T/t/gas flows) identical to the Ni–NHGF procedure.

**Control Sample Synthesis:**

1.  **non-holey Ni–NGF:**
    *   Follow the standard Ni–NHGF procedure but **omit the addition of H₂O₂** during the hydrothermal step.
    *   **Result:** Nickel-doped Nitrogen-doped Graphene Framework *without* holes.

2.  **metal-free NHGF:**
    *   Follow the standard Ni–NHGF procedure but **omit the addition of the NiCl₂·6H₂O** precursor.
    *   **Result:** Holey Nitrogen-doped Graphene Framework *without* any metal doping.

**Key Features of the Synthesis:**
*   **Two-Step Process:** Hydrothermal gel formation followed by thermal annealing/doping.
*   **Hole Formation:** Critically dependent on adding H₂O₂ during the hydrothermal step.
*   **Metal Doping:** Achieved by adding the respective metal chloride precursor (NiCl₂, FeCl₃, CoCl₂) during the hydrothermal step.
*   **Nitrogen Doping:** Achieved during the high-temperature annealing step using NH₃ gas.
*   **Reduction & Graphitization:** Achieved during the high-temperature annealing step under Ar/NH₃.
