question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Catalyst synthesis. Details of the synthesis of Fe-doped ZIF-8 can be found elsewhere27,39. In brief, 0.95 mM Zn(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O and 0.05 mM FeSO 4 ·7H 2 O as metal sources, and 8.21 g of 2-methylimidazole as the organic linker, were mixed with methanol to form Fe-doped ZIF-8. The excess organic linker and metal sources were removed by washing the product three times with absolute ethanol. After drying in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight, Fe-doped ZIF-8 precursor was directly heat-treated in Ar gas (99.99% purity) at 1,000 °C for 1 h to derive the final Fe–N–C catalyst. Atomically dispersed Fe atoms were uniformly distributed on the N–C framework without further acid washes. The weight of Fe loading in the final catalyst was around 2.0 wt%. According to our previous work, impregnation of Fe–N–C with an ultralow Pt loading could significantly promote the durability of Fe–N–C, but it did not present a noticeable activity improvement, especially in the kinetic region39. In this follow-up work, ammonia heat treatment was designed to expose more active sites and tailor the properties of the carbon support and the coordination number of single atoms. Secondary Ar pyrolysis after ammonia treatment is designed to stabilize the carbon framework. Thus, Fe-doped ZIF-8 was used as the support for Pt impregnation in this work to simplify heat treatment protocols. Pt(II) acetylacetonate (10 mg) was homogeneously dispersed in 3 ml of ethanol via ultrasonication until the solvent became transparent. In the meantime, 110 mg of 1,10-phenanthroline monohydrate dissolved in 10 ml of ethanol was added to the Pt solution to provide a sufficient nitrogen source for Pt coordination. Around 400 mg of Fe-doped ZIF-8 was added to the above solution to form a uniform suspension. After drying at 60 °C in a vacuum oven overnight, the solid was collected and ball milled (ZrO 2 ball, 350 revolutions per minute (r.p.m.), 4 h) to uniformly distribute Pt and N sources on the Fe-doped ZIF-8 support. The mixed precursors were first treated in NH 3 gas at 900 °C for 15 min and then transferred to an Ar atmosphere at 1,000 °C for 1 h to remove Zn in the precursor and stabilize the whole carbon framework to produce the final catalyst, Pt-Fe-N-C. The Pt and Fe loadings were around 1.7 and 2.0 wt%, respectively. As a reference electrocatalyst, Pt–N–C was prepared from a ZIF-8 support, which was formed by mixing 1 mM Zn(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O and 8.21 g of 2-methylimidazole in a methanol solvent and following the same collecting and drying protocols as for Fe-doped ZIF-8. Similarly, 10 mg of platinum(II) acetylacetonate was homogeneously dispersed in 3 ml of ethanol via ultrasonication until the solvent became transparent. In the meantime, 110 mg of 1,10-phenanthroline monohydrate dissolved in 10 ml of ethanol was added to the Pt solution to provide a sufficient nitrogen source for Pt coordination. Around 400 mg of ZIF-8 was added to this solution to form a uniform suspension. After drying at 60 °C in a vacuum oven overnight, the solid was collected and ball milled (ZrO 2 ball, 350 r.p.m., 4 h) to uniformly distribute the Pt and N sources on the ZIF-8 support. The mixed precursors were also initially treated in NH 3 gas at 900 °C for 15 min and then transferred into an Ar atmosphere at 1,000 °C for 1 h. The final catalyst, Pt–N–C, had a Pt loading of 2.3 wt%.

reasoning: 

Alright, the user wants me to summarize the catalyst synthesis procedures from a detailed paragraph. Let me start by understanding what exactly they need. They mentioned being a professional chemist specializing in catalysts, so they probably want a concise yet thorough breakdown of the synthesis steps.

First, I need to identify the catalysts being synthesized. The paragraph mentions two catalysts: Fe-N-C and Pt-Fe-N-C. The Fe-N-C is derived from Fe-doped ZIF-8, which is then heat-treated. The Pt-Fe-N-C involves adding platinum to the Fe-doped ZIF-8 support. There's also a reference catalyst, Pt-N-C, made from undoped ZIF-8. 

Looking at the synthesis steps for Fe-N-C: They mix zinc nitrate, iron sulfate, and 2-methylimidazole in methanol. After washing and drying, they pyrolyze it in argon. The key here is the metal sources and the pyrolysis conditions. The iron loading is about 2.0 wt%, and they mention no acid wash, which is important for the structure.

For Pt-Fe-N-C, they start with the Fe-doped ZIF-8 as a support. They prepare a platinum solution with acetylacetonate and phenanthroline, then mix it with the support. After ball milling, they do a two-step heat treatment: ammonia followed by argon. The Pt and Fe loadings are specified. The ammonia step is meant to expose more active sites, and the secondary argon pyrolysis stabilizes the framework. 

The reference catalyst Pt-N-C is similar but uses undoped ZIF-8. The steps are almost identical, but without iron. Pt loading is higher here. 

I should make sure to highlight the differences between the catalysts, especially the use of iron doping and the ammonia treatment. The user might be interested in why certain steps are taken, like the ammonia heat treatment for exposing active sites. Also, noting the loadings and the absence of acid wash in Fe-N-C synthesis is crucial.

The user's deeper need might be understanding the synthesis for replication or comparison. They might be looking for key details like precursors, temperatures, times, and any special conditions. Ensuring clarity in each step and specifying the catalysts' compositions is essential. Also, explaining the purpose of each step, like ball milling for uniform distribution, could be important for their application.
