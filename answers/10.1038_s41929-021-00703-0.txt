question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Preparation of α-MnO 2 nanofibres. In a typical procedure for synthesizing α-MnO 2 nanofibres, 0.02 mol of MnSO 4 ‧ 5H 2 O (analytical reagent, AR), 0.02 mol of (NH 4 ) 2 S 2 O 8 (AR) and 0.06 mol of K 2 SO 4 (AR) were dissolved in 70 ml H 2 O. After vigorous stirring for 1 h, the mixture was transferred to an autoclave and heated at 140 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the as-obtained dark brown powders were washed five times with deionized water, separated via vacuum filtration and dried overnight in an oven at 80 °C.

Preparation of the Ru/MnO 2 nanofibres. In a typical procedure, 1.15 mmol of MnO 2 nanofibres were dispersed in 20 ml H 2 O and sonicated for 30 min. A certain amount of RuCl 3 ‧ xH 2 O (AR) was dissolved in 20 ml of H 2 O. The RuCl 3 solution was injected into the MnO 2 suspension at room temperature under vigorous stirring. The reaction was continued for 12 h. The products were then collected by vacuum filtration and washed several times with deionized water. After drying in an oven at 80 °C, the products obtained were further annealed at 200 °C for 1 h in air. RuCl 3 concentrations of 2.41, 4.82 and 19.28 mmol l−1 were used for 4Ru/MnO 2 , 6Ru/MnO 2 and 12Ru/MnO 2 , respectively, with accurate Ru percentages at 3.8, 5.8 and 11.6 (determined by ICP-OES analysis).

Preparation of the homemade RuO 2 . In a typical procedure, 0.75 g RuCl 3 ‧ xH 2 O (AR) was dissolved in a 140 ml mixed solution containing H 2 O and methanol solution (v/v = 1:1). Then 1 M KOH was injected into the RuCl 3 solution to control the pH at approximately 7. After stirring for 1 h, the precipitate was collected via centrifugation and washed five times in a water and ethanol (v/v = 1:1) solution. After drying overnight at 80 °C, the black powder obtained was annealed at 500 °C for 5 h in air.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalysts described in the provided paragraph with all procedural details. Let me carefully analyze this text.

First, I see three distinct catalyst preparations here: α-MnO₂ nanofibers, Ru/MnO₂ nanofibers (with different Ru loadings), and homemade RuO₂. The user specifically wants synthesis procedures with all details, so I need to extract every quantitative and qualitative aspect.

For the α-MnO₂ nanofibers, the precursors are clearly listed: 0.02 mol MnSO₄·5H₂O, 0.02 mol (NH₄)₂S₂O₈, and 0.06 mol K₂SO₄ dissolved in 70 ml water. The process involves vigorous stirring (1h), hydrothermal treatment (140°C for 12h in autoclave), followed by washing (5x DI water), vacuum filtration, and drying (80°C overnight). The product is dark brown powder - that's important to note.

Moving to Ru/MnO₂ nanofibers, this builds upon the first material. They start with 1.15 mmol of the pre-made MnO₂ nanofibers dispersed in 20ml water via sonication (30 min). Then RuCl₃·xH₂O solution (in 20ml water) is added to the suspension with vigorous stirring at room temperature for 12h. The washing/filtration/drying steps are similar but with an additional annealing step (200°C for 1h in air). The Ru concentrations vary: 2.41 mmol/L for 4Ru/MnO₂, 4.82 for 6Ru/MnO₂, 19.28 for 12Ru/MnO₂ - corresponding to actual Ru loadings of 3.8%, 5.8%, 11.6% as verified by ICP-OES. I should emphasize that these are supported catalysts where Ru is deposited on MnO₂ nanofibers.

The homemade RuO₂ is simpler: dissolve 0.75g RuCl₃·xH₂O in 140ml H₂O:methanol (1:1 v/v), adjust pH to ~7 with 1M KOH, stir 1h, then centrifuge and wash with water:ethanol (1:1 v/v). After drying (80°C overnight), it's annealed at much higher temperature (500°C for 5h in air) to form the oxide.

The user is likely a researcher or student needing precise replication details. They might be comparing catalyst systems or studying support effects. Since they specified "all details," I'll include even minor steps like sonication time and washing solvents. The Ru loadings are particularly crucial for catalytic performance studies. I should present this systematically while maintaining technical accuracy - that's what a professional chemist would expect.
