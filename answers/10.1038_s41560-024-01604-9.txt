question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Synthesis of NiMoO x The NiMoO x was synthesized in the same way as Ni@C-MoO x except replacing sodium copper chlorophyllin with carbon black (Vulcan XC-72R).

Synthesis of Ni/CuChl The Ni/CuChl was synthesized in the same way as Ni@C-MoO x except without adding ammonium molybdate ((NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 ).

Synthesis of Ni@C-MoO x -N 2 The Ni@C-MoO x -N 2 was synthesized in the same way as Ni@C-MoO x except annealed in N 2 instead of H 2 .

Synthesis of Ni@C-MoO x -TP The Ni@C-MoO x -TP was synthesized in the same way as Ni@C-MoO x except using tetraphenyl porphyrin (TP) instead of CuChl.

Synthesis of Ni@C-MoO x A typical method for the synthesis of Ni@C-MoO x included 1 g Ni(CH 3 COO) 2 , 0.353 g (NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 , 1 g urea and 0.1 g sodium copper chlorophyllin being added in 35 ml deionized water. After stirring vig- orously for 0.5 h, the solution was transferred to a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, then heated to 180 °C and maintained for 12 h. The autoclave was then cooled to room temperature. The obtained product was washed with deionized water and ethanol to remove ionic residue and then dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight. The resulting pow- der was heated in a tube furnace up to 500 °C at a ramp rate of 5 °C min −1 under H 2 /N 2 (with 1:9 mole ratio) gas flow, and the heating was main- tained at 500 °C for 2 h. Afterwards the furnace was cooled to room temperature under N 2 flow, the product Ni@C-MoO x was collected.

Synthesis of MoO x One g (NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 was heated in a tube furnace up to 500 °C at a ramp rate of 5 °C min −1 under H 2 /N 2 (with 1:9 mole ratio) gas flow, and the heating was maintained at 500 °C for 2 h. Afterwards the furnace

Synthesis of C-MoO x A 0.353 g amount of (NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 and 0.1 g sodium copper chloro- phyllin were added in 35 ml deionized water; after drying at 65 °C, the powder was heated in a tube furnace up to 500 °C at a ramp rate of 5 °C min −1 under H 2 /N 2 (with 1:9 mole ratio) gas flow, and the heating was maintained at 500 °C for 2 h. Afterwards the furnace was cooled to room temperature under N 2 flow, the product C-MoO x was collected.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis. They've provided several catalyst synthesis procedures that all reference a base method (Ni@C-MoOₓ), and I need to extract and summarize each one with full details. 

First, I notice the user is likely a researcher or student working with nickel-molybdenum catalysts, probably for electrocatalysis or similar applications given the carbon-supported metal oxide systems. They've presented interconnected synthesis methods where most variations are defined by their deviations from the Ni@C-MoOₓ protocol. 

The core Ni@C-MoOₓ synthesis is fully described, so I'll start by dissecting that: 
- Precursors: Nickel acetate, ammonium molybdate, urea, sodium copper chlorophyllin (CuChl) in water
- Hydrothermal step: 180°C for 12h in Teflon autoclave
- Post-treatment: Washing, drying, then annealing at 500°C under H₂/N₂ (1:9) with controlled ramp/cool rates

Now for the variants:
- NiMoOₓ: Simple substitution of CuChl with carbon black (Vulcan XC-72R). Important to note this removes the carbon source from chlorophyllin.
- Ni/CuChl: Omission of ammonium molybdate - so no Mo component, just nickel on carbon from CuChl.
- Ni@C-MoOₓ-N₂: Critical atmosphere change - N₂ instead of H₂/N₂ during annealing. This likely affects reduction/oxidation states.
- Ni@C-MoOₓ-TP: Replacement of CuChl with tetraphenyl porphyrin. Structurally similar carbon precursor but different metal (Cu vs none in TP).
- MoOₓ and C-MoOₓ: Simpler syntheses without nickel, showing the isolated components. 

I should emphasize the annealing conditions since gas atmosphere and temperature profiles are crucial for catalyst properties. Also noting where carbon sources differ (chlorophyllin vs porphyrin vs carbon black) is essential for material characteristics. 

The user didn't specify application context, but these catalysts are clearly designed for comparative studies - probably testing how carbon support, metal loading, or annealing atmosphere affect performance. I'll keep the summary strictly procedural since they asked for "all details," avoiding assumptions about catalytic mechanisms. 

One tricky part: The MoOₓ synthesis description cuts off mid-sentence, but from context it's clearly identical to the annealing step in other procedures. I'll extrapolate logically. Also making sure to clarify that "the same way as" references the full Ni@C-MoOₓ process unless otherwise specified. 

Finally, organizing by base method first, then variants - this mirrors how they're presented and shows the systematic modifications. Highlighting stoichiometry (like 1:9 H₂/N₂) and exact masses since those are critical for reproducibility.

**Key Observations on Synthesis Strategy:**
*   **Ni@C-MoOₓ** is the foundational synthesis, combining Ni²⁺, Mo₇O₂₄⁶⁻, urea (likely as pH modifier/structure-directing agent), and a carbon/nitrogen source (CuChl/TP) via **hydrothermal synthesis** followed by **controlled annealing** under reducing/inert atmosphere (H₂/N₂).
*   Variations are systematically created by:
    *   **Precursor Substitution:** CuChl → Carbon Black (NiMoOₓ), CuChl → TP (Ni@C-MoOₓ-TP).
    *   **Precursor Omission:** Omit Mo source (Ni/CuChl).
    *   **Annealing Atmosphere Change:** H₂/N₂ → N₂ (Ni@C-MoOₓ-N₂).
*   **Component Isolation:** Syntheses of MoOₓ (only Mo precursor) and C-MoOₓ (Mo precursor + carbon source, no Ni) provide reference materials lacking key components of the main catalyst.
*   The annealing step (500°C, 2h, 5°C/min ramp/cool) under controlled gas flow (H₂/N₂ or N₂) is **critical** for forming the final active phases (metal, oxide, carbon coating) and is consistent across most syntheses involving thermal treatment.
