question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Preparation of nanoglues and support materials SiO 2 -supported CeO x . In general, OH − ions in alkaline solutions act as strong coordination agents for Ce 3+ ions to form cationic complexes, but excessive OH − results in precipitation of Ce(OH) 3 (solubility prod- uct constant K sp = 1.6 × 10 −20 ) 31 . To avoid the formation of Ce(OH) 3 pre- cipitates from the solution phase, the concentration of the OH − was carefully controlled to maintain a relatively stable aqueous solution containing soluble [Ce(OH) 2 ] + and [Ce(OH)] 2+ complexes 31 . Dissolved O 2 in the aqueous solution slowly oxidizes Ce 3+ into Ce 4+ , the concentration of which grows with time to reach the precipitation limit of Ce(OH) 4 (K sp = 2 × 10 −48 ) 31 . Under well controlled synthesis conditions, the strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA) of [Ce(OH) 2 ] + and [Ce(OH)] 2+ occurs within minutes 18 , a much shorter time than that needed for precipi- tating Ce(OH) 4 . Such a time difference in the dynamic adsorption and precipitation processes allows efficient, facile production of uniformly decorated high-surface-area SiO 2 with Ce species via the SEA process. In a typical procedure for synthesizing 12 wt% CeO x nanoglue islands on SiO 2 , 360 mg of fumed SiO 2 powder (Alfa Aesar, total Brunauer– Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area 278 m 2 g −1 ) was mixed with 100 ml of deionized (DI) water, and the resultant aqueous solution was soni- cated to produce a uniform mixture. Under vigorous stirring, 0.4 mmol of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 ·6H 2 O was dissolved in the above solution, and 0.8 ml of NH 3 ·H 2 O (2 M) was quickly injected into the solution with further stir- ring for 3 min prior to vacuum filtration. The final solution pH was about 8.7. The resultant precipitates were removed for air drying over- night at room temperature. The dried powders were ground to smaller particles and were then calcined in a muffle furnace at 500 or 600 °C (with a temperature ramp of 5 °C min −1 ) for 12 h. This facile synthesis protocol was easily scaled up to routinely produce 10 times more of the final product.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalyst and its synthesis procedure from a given paragraph. Let me carefully analyze this technical text.

The paragraph describes synthesizing CeOₓ nanoglues on SiO₂ support. First I need to identify the key components: the catalyst is cerium oxide nanoparticles ("nanoglue islands") supported on silica, with 12 wt% loading. The synthesis method is Strong Electrostatic Adsorption (SEA), which relies on controlling pH to form soluble cerium complexes that adsorb onto silica before precipitation occurs.

Hmm, the critical chemistry here involves balancing Ce³⁺ complexation with OH⁻ ions against precipitation. Too little OH⁻ and complexes don't form; too much causes Ce(OH)₃ precipitation. Then there's oxidation by dissolved oxygen forming Ce⁴⁺ which could lead to Ce(OH)₄ precipitation. The SEA process exploits the faster adsorption kinetics of [Ce(OH)₂]⁺ and [Ce(OH)]²⁺ complexes compared to precipitation rates.

Looking at the procedure: they start with fumed SiO₂ (278 m²/g BET area) dispersed in water. Then dissolve Ce(NO₃)₃·6H₂O and quickly add ammonia solution. The amounts are precise: 360mg SiO₂, 0.4mmol Ce salt, 0.8ml of 2M NH₃·H₂O. After just 3 minutes of stirring, they filter - this timing is crucial to beat precipitation. pH ends at 8.7. Then drying, grinding, and calcining at 500-600°C for 12 hours.

The user is probably a researcher or student needing clear technical details. They might be replicating this synthesis or designing similar catalysts. I should emphasize the critical control parameters: pH management, timing, concentrations. Also note the scalability claim - they made 10x batches. I'll organize this systematically: catalyst composition first, then step-by-step procedure with quantities, then key scientific principles enabling success.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here's a professional summary of the synthesized catalyst and its detailed synthesis procedure:

**Synthesized Catalyst:**
*   **Composition:** CeOₓ nanoglues (cerium oxide nanoparticles) supported on SiO₂.
*   **Loading:** 12 wt% CeOₓ relative to SiO₂.
*   **Morphology:** Uniformly decorated high-surface-area SiO₂ with CeOₓ "islands" (nanoglues).
*   **Support Material:** Fumed SiO₂ powder (278 m² g⁻¹ BET surface area).
*   **Final Form:** Calcined powder (CeOₓ/SiO₂).

**Synthesis Procedure (Strong Electrostatic Adsorption - SEA):**

1.  **SiO₂ Dispersion:**
    *   360 mg of fumed SiO₂ powder (Alfa Aesar, BET SA = 278 m² g⁻¹) is mixed with 100 ml deionized (DI) water.
    *   The mixture is sonicated to produce a uniform aqueous suspension.

2.  **Ce³⁺ Solution Addition:**
    *   Under vigorous stirring, 0.4 mmol of Ce(NO₃)₃·6H₂₀ is dissolved into the SiO₂ suspension.

3.  **pH Adjustment & Complex Formation:**
    *   0.8 ml of NH₃·H₂O (2 M, aqueous ammonia) is quickly injected into the vigorously stirred suspension.
    *   **Critical Control:** This carefully controlled amount of base provides sufficient OH⁻ to form soluble cationic complexes like [Ce(OH)₂]⁺ and [Ce(OH)]²⁺, but avoids excessive OH⁻ that would cause immediate precipitation of Ce(OH)₃ (K_sp = 1.6 × 10⁻²⁰).
    *   The final solution pH is approximately 8.7.

4.  **Adsorption & Timing Control:**
    *   Stirring continues for **exactly 3 minutes** after ammonia injection.
    *   **Critical Control:** This short time exploits the rapid kinetics of Strong Electrostatic Adsorption (SEA) of the soluble Ce³⁺ complexes ([Ce(OH)₂]⁺, [Ce(OH)]²⁺) onto the negatively charged SiO₂ surface. This occurs much faster than the oxidation of Ce³⁺ to Ce⁴⁺ by dissolved O₂ and the subsequent slow precipitation of Ce(OH)₄ (K_sp = 2 × 10⁻⁴⁸).

5.  **Filtration & Washing:**
    *   After 3 minutes of stirring, the suspension is immediately subjected to vacuum filtration.
    *   The collected solids (SiO₂ with adsorbed Ce complexes) are washed (implied by filtration, though washing details aren't explicitly stated).

6.  **Drying:**
    *   The filtered precipitates (wet cake) are air-dried overnight at room temperature.

7.  **Grinding:**
    *   The dried powder is ground to reduce particle size.

8.  **Calcination:**
    *   The ground powder is calcined in a muffle furnace.
    *   **Temperature Program:** Ramp rate = 5 °C min⁻¹ to the target temperature.
    *   **Target Temperature & Time:** Either 500 °C or 600 °C, held for 12 hours.
    *   **Purpose:** Converts the adsorbed cerium hydroxo complexes into the final CeOₓ nanoglue islands.

**Key Scientific Principles Leveraged:**
*   **Complexation Control:** Precise OH⁻ concentration via ammonia addition prevents Ce(OH)₃ precipitation while forming soluble cationic Ce³⁺ complexes.
*   **Kinetic Advantage:** Rapid SEA adsorption of complexes onto SiO₂ occurs before dissolved O₂ oxidizes enough Ce³⁺ to Ce⁴⁺ to cause Ce(OH)₄ precipitation.
*   **Electrostatics:** SEA relies on the attraction between positively charged Ce complexes and the negatively charged SiO₂ surface at pH ~8.7.
*   **Scalability:** The procedure is confirmed to be easily scaled up to produce 10 times the described batch size routinely.

**Final Product:** The output is a calcined CeOₓ/SiO₂ catalyst powder with 12 wt% CeOₓ loading, featuring uniformly dispersed cerium oxide nanoglue islands on the high-surface-area silica support.
