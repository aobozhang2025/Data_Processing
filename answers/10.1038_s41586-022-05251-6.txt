question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Preparation of nanoglues and support materials SiO 2 -supported CeO x . In general, OH − ions in alkaline solutions act as strong coordination agents for Ce 3+ ions to form cationic complexes, but excessive OH − results in precipitation of Ce(OH) 3 (solubility prod- uct constant K sp = 1.6 × 10 −20 ) 31 . To avoid the formation of Ce(OH) 3 pre- cipitates from the solution phase, the concentration of the OH − was carefully controlled to maintain a relatively stable aqueous solution containing soluble [Ce(OH) 2 ] + and [Ce(OH)] 2+ complexes 31 . Dissolved O 2 in the aqueous solution slowly oxidizes Ce 3+ into Ce 4+ , the concentration of which grows with time to reach the precipitation limit of Ce(OH) 4 (K sp = 2 × 10 −48 ) 31 . Under well controlled synthesis conditions, the strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA) of [Ce(OH) 2 ] + and [Ce(OH)] 2+ occurs within minutes 18 , a much shorter time than that needed for precipi- tating Ce(OH) 4 . Such a time difference in the dynamic adsorption and precipitation processes allows efficient, facile production of uniformly decorated high-surface-area SiO 2 with Ce species via the SEA process. In a typical procedure for synthesizing 12 wt% CeO x nanoglue islands on SiO 2 , 360 mg of fumed SiO 2 powder (Alfa Aesar, total Brunauer– Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area 278 m 2 g −1 ) was mixed with 100 ml of deionized (DI) water, and the resultant aqueous solution was soni- cated to produce a uniform mixture. Under vigorous stirring, 0.4 mmol of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 ·6H 2 O was dissolved in the above solution, and 0.8 ml of NH 3 ·H 2 O (2 M) was quickly injected into the solution with further stir- ring for 3 min prior to vacuum filtration. The final solution pH was about 8.7. The resultant precipitates were removed for air drying over- night at room temperature. The dried powders were ground to smaller particles and were then calcined in a muffle furnace at 500 or 600 °C (with a temperature ramp of 5 °C min −1 ) for 12 h. This facile synthesis protocol was easily scaled up to routinely produce 10 times more of the final product.

reasoning: 

Alright, the user wants me to summarize the catalyst synthesis described in the paragraph. Let me start by identifying the key components. The catalyst is CeOₓ nanoglue islands supported on SiO₂. The main challenge here is avoiding precipitation of cerium hydroxides during synthesis.

First, the paragraph explains that controlling OH⁻ concentration is crucial. Too much OH⁻ leads to Ce(OH)₃ or Ce(OH)₄ precipitates. The method uses Strong Electrostatic Adsorption (SEA) to adsorb cerium complexes onto SiO₂ before precipitation occurs. The time difference between adsorption and oxidation/precipitation is key.

Looking at the procedure: they start with fumed SiO₂ powder, mix it with water, and sonicate. Then they add Ce(NO₃)₃·6H₂O and quickly inject ammonia solution. Stirring for only 3 minutes before filtration is important because it's faster than the oxidation time that causes precipitation. The pH is around 8.7, which is controlled to keep cerium soluble as [Ce(OH)₂]⁺ and [Ce(OH)]²⁺ complexes.

After filtration, the material is air-dried and then calcined at high temperatures. The calcination step converts the adsorbed cerium into CeOₓ islands. The user mentioned scaling up the process, which is a plus for industrial applications.

I should make sure to highlight the SEA mechanism and the precise control of pH and timing. Also, note the specific amounts: 360 mg SiO₂, 100 ml water, 0.4 mmol cerium nitrate, and 0.8 ml of 2M ammonia. The cerium loading is 12 wt%, and the calcination conditions are 500-600°C for 12 hours.

The user is likely a chemist or researcher needing detailed synthesis steps for replication. They might be interested in the nuances of avoiding precipitation and the scalability. Emphasizing the critical steps like quick ammonia injection and short stirring time is essential. Also, explaining why each step is done—like sonication for dispersion and calcination for oxide formation—adds clarity. Making sure all parameters are clearly presented will help them apply the method effectively.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here's a detailed summary of the synthesized catalyst and its synthesis procedure:

**Synthesized Catalyst:**
*   **Name:** SiO₂-supported CeOₓ nanoglue islands
*   **Composition:** Cerium oxide (CeOₓ, where x indicates non-stoichiometry) deposited as nano-islands ("nanoglues") on a high-surface-area fumed silica (SiO₂) support.
*   **Cerium Loading:** 12 wt% CeOₓ relative to SiO₂.
*   **Key Feature:** Uniform decoration of the SiO₂ surface achieved via the Strong Electrostatic Adsorption (SEA) mechanism.

**Synthesis Procedure (Detailed Steps):**

1.  **Support Preparation:**
    *   Weigh 360 mg of fumed SiO₂ powder (Alfa Aesar, BET surface area = 278 m²/g).
    *   Add the SiO₂ to 100 ml of deionized (DI) water.
    *   Sonicate the mixture to produce a uniform suspension/aqueous solution.

2.  **Cerium Precursor Addition:**
    *   Under vigorous stirring, dissolve 0.4 mmol of Ce(NO₃)₃·6H₂O (cerium(III) nitrate hexahydrate) into the SiO₂ suspension.

3.  **pH Adjustment & Complex Formation:**
    *   Quickly inject 0.8 ml of NH₃·H₂O (ammonium hydroxide, 2 M concentration) into the stirring solution.
    *   **Critical Control:** This addition provides OH⁻ ions. The amount is carefully chosen to:
        *   Form soluble cationic cerium complexes: [Ce(OH)₂]⁺ and [Ce(OH)]²⁺.
        *   Avoid immediate precipitation of Ce(OH)₃ (Ksp = 1.6 × 10⁻²⁰) or later precipitation of Ce(OH)₄ (formed by oxidation of Ce³⁺ to Ce⁴⁺ by dissolved O₂, Ksp = 2 × 10⁻⁴⁸).

4.  **Adsorption (SEA):**
    *   Continue vigorous stirring for exactly **3 minutes** after ammonia injection.
    *   **Mechanism:** During this short time, the positively charged cerium complexes ([Ce(OH)₂]⁺ and [Ce(OH)]²⁺) are strongly electrostatically adsorbed (SEA) onto the negatively charged SiO₂ surface (at the achieved pH ~8.7). This adsorption occurs much faster than the oxidation of Ce³⁺ to Ce⁴⁺ and subsequent precipitation of Ce(OH)₄.

5.  **Separation:**
    *   After 3 minutes of stirring, immediately perform **vacuum filtration** to separate the solid material (SiO₂ with adsorbed cerium complexes) from the liquid.
    *   *Note:* The final pH of the solution at this point is approximately 8.7.

6.  **Drying:**
    *   Air-dry the collected solid precipitates overnight at room temperature.

7.  **Grinding:**
    *   Grind the dried powder to obtain smaller particles.

8.  **Calcination:**
    *   Transfer the ground powder to a muffle furnace.
    *   Calcinate the material at either **500 °C or 600 °C** for **12 hours**.
    *   Use a temperature ramp rate of **5 °C per minute**.
    *   **Purpose:** This step decomposes the adsorbed cerium complexes/hydroxides and converts them into the final cerium oxide (CeOₓ) "nanoglue islands" on the SiO₂ support.

**Scalability:** The procedure is designed to be easily scaled up, routinely producing batches 10 times larger than the described typical procedure.

**Key Scientific Principles Employed:**
*   **pH Control:** Precise OH⁻ concentration to form soluble cationic Ce³⁺ complexes and avoid hydroxide precipitation.
*   **Kinetic Advantage (SEA):** Exploiting the faster rate of electrostatic adsorption onto the support compared to the slower rate of Ce³⁺ oxidation to Ce⁴⁺ and subsequent insoluble Ce(OH)₄ formation.
*   **Strong Electrostatic Adsorption (SEA):** Utilizing the electrostatic attraction between cationic metal complexes and a negatively charged support surface at controlled pH for uniform deposition.
