question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Preparation of nitride-derived trimetallic electrocatalysts and deposition onto GDE At first, 0.4 g Cu nanoparticles (25 nm, Sigma-Aldrich) were sus- pended in an aqueous solution of HAuCl 4 to make a galvanic exchange reaction at 60 °C for 30 min, with the concentration of Au in the solution corresponding to 0.3–3 mol% with respect to the Cu con- tent from Cu nanoparticles. The obtained powder (named CuAu x% ) was then washed with water and ethanol (96°, Carlo Erba), isolated by centrifugation and then dried in air. After that, the thus-obtained powder was added into an aqueous solution of AgNO 3 , in which the Ag content was equivalent to 0.1–1 mol% with respect to the amount of the initial Cu powder. The obtained powder (denoted as CuAu x% Ag y% ) was then washed with water and ethanol (96°, Carlo Erba), isolated by centrifugation and then dried in air before calcination at 500 °C for 1 h in air. The calcined sample (40 mg) was mixed with 400 mg NaNH 2 (98%, Sigma-Aldrich) in a glovebox filled with argon and the mixture was put in an autoclave (in the glovebox). The autoclave was then heated in a furnace at 170 °C for 20 h to form the Au–Ag-co-doped copper nitride material. After cooling down, 20 ml ethanol was added into the autoclave to form a suspension and then the material was collected by centrifugation, washed with water and ethanol, and finally dried in air before using it for a catalytic reaction. The control Au-doped or Ag-doped copper nitride material was prepared by using the same protocol. A scheme is provided to summarize the synthesis procedure (Supplementary Fig. 1). Preparation of GDE: a suspension was prepared with ratio of 1 mg catalyst powder with 5 μl solution of 5% Nafion (Sigma-Aldrich) and added to 100 μl ethanol. Then, 120 μl solution was drop-cast onto 1 cm 2 GDL (AvCarb GDS5130, Dioxide Materials) heated on a hotplate at 60 °C to obtain a load of 1.2 mg catalyst/1 cm 2 GDL. This modified GDL was then used as the cathode in electrochemical assays.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize a specific catalyst synthesis procedure from a given paragraph. Let me carefully analyze this technical text.

First, I need to identify the key catalyst being synthesized. The paragraph describes creating "nitride-derived trimetallic electrocatalysts" with copper (Cu), gold (Au) and silver (Ag). The final material is referred to as "Au-Ag-co-doped copper nitride", which is a trimetallic nitride catalyst.

The synthesis has multiple stages. It starts with Cu nanoparticles undergoing galvanic exchange with HAuCl4 to form CuAu bimetallic particles. Then silver is introduced via reaction with AgNO3 solution, creating ternary CuAuAg particles. This is followed by calcination and then nitridation using NaNH2 at 170°C to form the copper nitride structure doped with Au and Ag.

The deposition onto gas diffusion electrodes (GDE) is also described, using Nafion binder and ethanol solvent, with specific loading details (1.2 mg/cm² on GDL).

The user seems to be a researcher or student needing a clear, technical breakdown. They likely want precise details for replication or understanding. I should ensure all molar percentages, temperatures, times, and reagents are accurately captured. The control samples mentioned (Au-only or Ag-only doped copper nitride) should also be noted as they're important for comparative studies.

I notice the synthesis involves glovebox handling for air-sensitive steps and multiple washing/isolation steps - these practical details matter for reproducibility. The electrochemical application context (cathode preparation) should be included since it affects the final catalyst form.

The summary must maintain all critical parameters: nanoparticle sizes (25nm Cu), concentration ranges (Au 0.3-3 mol%, Ag 0.1-1 mol%), exact temperatures (60°C exchange, 500°C calcination, 170°C nitridation), and durations. The Nafion ratio (5% solution) and GDE loading specification are equally crucial.

I'll organize this chronologically while highlighting the trimetallic nitride nature of the final catalyst, as that's the key innovation here. The professional tone should reflect catalysis expertise while remaining accessible.
