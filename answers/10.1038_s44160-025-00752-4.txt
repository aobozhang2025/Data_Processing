question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Synthesis of the Pr 6 O 11 –Cu-CS and Pr 6 O 11 –Cu-SC catalysts The Pr 6 O 11 –Cu-CS catalyst was synthesized by a co-precipitation and stepwise calcination method. First, Cu(CH 3 COO) 2 (1 mmol) and Pr(CH 3 COO) 3 ·6H 2 O (4 mmol) were dissolved in a mixture of 100 ml deionized water and ethanol (3:7 vol/vol) by an ultrasonic device, and then heated to 50 °C with vigorous stirring. A mixture of (NH 4 ) 2 CO 3 (3 mmol) and KOH (10 mmol) was dissolved in 15 ml deionized water to form a co-precipitating agent, which was then slowly dropped into the previously prepared mixed solvent containing the precursor, and stirred for 30 min. Then the temperature was raised to 85 °C stirring continued for 2 h. The mixture was evaporated using a rotary evapora- tor and dried under vacuum at 120 °C for 12 h. After grinding the solid with an agate mortar, the powder was calcined under air at 500 °C for 3 h (heating rate, 10 °C min −1 ). After rinsing with deionized water and etha- nol three times, the powder was dried at 80 °C for 12 h, and then calcined in argon at 600 °C for 2 h (heating rate, 2 °C min −1 ). A light grey powder was obtained and named Pr 6 O 11 –Cu-CS. The Pr 6 O 11 –Cu-SC catalyst was synthesized by a stepwise precipitation and co-calcination method. The preparation method was similar to that of Pr 6 O 11 –Cu-SS, with the only difference being that the temperature of the first calcination process was raised to 600 °C, discarding the second calcination process in argon. A light brown powder was obtained and named Pr 6 O 11 –Cu-SC.

Methods Synthesis of the Pr 6 O 11 –Cu-SS catalyst The catalysts were synthesized by a stepwise precipitation and stepwise calcination method using different mole ratios of the Cu(CH 3 COO) 2 to Pr(CH 3 COO) 3 ·6H 2 O. First, Cu(CH 3 COO) 2 (1 mmol) and Pr(CH 3 COO) 3 ·6H 2 O (4 mmol) were dissolved in a mixture of 100 ml deionized water and ethanol (3:7 vol/vol) by an ultrasonic device, and then heated to 50 °C with vigorous stirring. (NH 4 ) 2 CO 3 (3 mmol) was dis- solved in 5 ml deionized water to form a precipitating agent, which was then slowly dropped into the previously prepared solution containing the precursors, and stirred for 30 min. Then the temperature was raised to 85 °C. KOH (10 mmol) was dissolved in 10 ml of deionized water to form a precipitating agent, which was slowly dropped into the prepared precipitating solution, and stirred for 2 h. The mixture was evaporated using a rotary evaporator and the solid was dried under vacuum at 120 °C for 12 h. After grinding the solid in an agate mortar, the powder was calcined under air at 500 °C for 3 h (heating rate, 10 °C min −1 ). After rinsing with deionized water and ethanol three times, the powder was dried at 80 °C for 12 h, and then calcined in argon at 600 °C for 2 h (heating rate, 2 °C min −1 ). A light grey powder was obtained and named as Pr 6 O 11 –Cu-SS (Pr 6 O 11 –Cu-4:1). The preparation methods of Pr 6 O 11 –Cu-9:1, Pr 6 O 11 –Cu-2:1, Pr 6 O 11 –Cu-1:1, Pr 6 O 11 –Cu-1:2, Pr 6 O 11 –Cu-1:4 and Pr 6 O 11 –Cu-1:9 electrocatalysts are similar to those of Pr 6 O 11 –Cu-SS, and the feeding ratios of Cu(CH 3 COO) 2 to Pr(CH 3 COO) 3 ·6H 2 O, and (NH 4 ) 2 CO 3 were changed to (mmol) 1:9:4, 1:2:2.5, 1:1:2.5, 2:1:4, 4:1:8 and 9:1:18, respectively.

Synthesis of the CuO and Pr 6 O 11 catalysts CuO and Pr 6 O 11 catalysts were prepared following similar synthetic pro- cedures as those for Pr 6 O 11 –Cu-SS catalyst, while 4 mmol Cu(CH 3 COO) 2 and 8 mmol KOH were used instead in preparation of CuO. Pr 6 O 11 catalyst was prepared with 4 mmol Pr(CH 3 COO) 3 ·6H 2 O and 10 mmol (NH 4 ) 2 CO 3 were used.

Synthesis of the RO x –Cu catalysts RO x –Cu catalysts (R = La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu, Tb, Gd and Er) were prepared following the similar synthetic procedures to those for Pr 6 O 11 –Cu-SS catalysts; the amounts of starting precursors used are listed in Sup- plementary Table 2.

reasoning: 

Alright, let me approach this query methodically. The user wants a chemist's summary of catalyst synthesis procedures from a technical paragraph. First, I need to identify the core catalysts described: Pr₆O₁₁-Cu composites with suffixes CS, SC, and SS indicating different synthesis methods. 

The text contains three distinct synthesis routes, so I'll organize them separately for clarity. For Pr₆O₁₁-Cu-CS, the co-precipitation method uses simultaneous addition of precipitating agents (ammonium carbonate and KOH), while the SS method employs stepwise precipitation. The SC variant simplifies calcination by eliminating the argon step. 

Key details to preserve include: precursor compounds (copper acetate, praseodymium acetate hydrate), solvent ratios (water-ethanol 3:7), precipitation sequences, thermal profiles (heating rates, temperatures), and washing/drying protocols. The mole ratios for different catalyst compositions (4:1, 9:1 etc.) must be precisely noted as they affect catalytic properties.

I notice the user specifically asked for "all details", so I'll include even minor steps like ultrasonic dissolution, grinding with agate mortar, and vacuum drying conditions. The color differences in final products (grey vs brown powders) may indicate structural variations worth mentioning. 

For the auxiliary catalysts (CuO, Pr₆O₁₁ alone, other rare earth-Cu), I'll briefly summarize since they follow modified versions of the main procedures. The reference to Supplementary Table 2 suggests possible follow-up data, but since it's not provided, I'll simply note the existence of additional rare earth variants.

The challenge is condensing repetitive steps without omitting critical variations - like how SC catalyst skips argon calcination, or how SS catalyst adds precipitating agents sequentially. Precision matters here since small procedural differences could significantly impact catalyst performance.
