question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Preparation of Ti 1 –rGO and rGO. The Ti 1 –rGO SAM sample was prepared via chemisorption route. First, 400 mg of graphite oxide was dispersed into 120 ml of isopropanol. Then, 20 μl of organic Ti salt (titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate)) was added into the above solution with continuous magnetic stirring, followed by ultrasonic dispersion for 1 h and magnetic stirring for 20 h. Afterwards, the above dispersion solution was centrifuged and the resulting precipitation was dried at 85 °C in vacuum for 24 h. Thereafter, the obtained powder was calcinated at 550 °C for 2 h in a high-purity N 2 atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the fluffy black powder was Ti 1 –rGO SAM. Likewise, rGO could be obtained by the same steps without adding organic Ti salt.

Fabrication of modular C-PSCs. Here, 10 mg of carbon material (rGO or Ti 1 –rGO) was dispersed into 20 ml of isopropanol solution, followed by ball-milling for 12 h. The dispersion slurry for spraying was obtained. FTO glasses were etched with zinc powder and 4 M HCl, rinsed with cleaning fluid, deionized water, ethanol, acetone and isopropanol, respectively.

Fabrication of architecture FTO/c-TiO 2 /mp-TiO 2 /perovskite 1 . When the FTO glass was preheated to 450 °C, the compact TiO 2 layer was deposited on the FTO glass by a spray pyrolysis method (the carrier gas is O 2 ). The precursor solution of the compact TiO 2 layer (c-TiO 2 ) was diluted 600 μl of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) and 400 μl of acetyl acetone with 9 ml of ethanol. After spray pyrolysis, the FTO/c-TiO 2 was sintered at 450 °C for 10 min before cooling down to room temperature. After that, mesoporous TiO 2 (mp-TiO 2 ) was deposited on the c-TiO 2 layer by spin coating for 20 s at 4,000 r.p.m. The precursor solution of m-TiO 2 was diluted the commercial TiO 2 paste (30NRD, Dyesol) with ethanol at a weight ratio of 1:6. The FTO/c-TiO 2 /mp-TiO 2 was heated at 450 °C for 30 min under dry air flow. To deposit the perovskite layer, one-step spin-coating method was adopted to prepare the Cs 0.05 FA 0.85 MA 0.10 Pb(I 0.97 Br 0.03 ) 3 perovskite layer with 5% excess of PbI 2 in 1 ml of mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (4:1 volume ratio). Subsequently, 120 μl of perovskite solution was spin coated on the ETL via a two-step spin-coating programme with 2,000 r.p.m. for 10 s with an acceleration rate of 200 r.p.m. s−1 and 6,000 r.p.m. for 30 s with an acceleration rate of 2,000 r.p.m. s−1, respectively. Then 300 μl of antisolvent (chlorobenzene) was dropped on the spinning substrates 15 s before the end of programme, followed by annealing at 120 °C for 20 min.

Fabrication of architecture FTO/SnO 2 /perovskite 2 . The 0.1 M SnCl 2 2H 2 O isopropanol solution was refluxed at 85 °C for 3 h to obtain the SnO 2 sol for the ETL of PSCs. The prepared precursor was spin coated on the FTO glass at 2,000 r.p.m. for 30 s, followed by thermal treatment at 80 °C for 1 h in the air. After that, the as-deposited SnO 2 ETL was treated with UV-Ozoneor 20 min. To deposit the perovskite layer, one-step spin-coating method was adopted to prepare the Cs 0.05 ((FAPbI 3 ) 0.85 (MAPbBr 3 ) 0.15 ) 0.95 perovskite layer. Typically, FAI (1 M), PbI 2 (1.1 M), MABr (0.2 M) and PbBr 2 (0.2 M) were dissolved in 1 ml of mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (4:1 volume ratio), and then stirred at 60 °C for 2 h. Next, 1 M CsI DMSO solution was added to the above perovskite precursor solution with a volume ratio of 5:95. Subsequently, 120 μl of perovskite solution was spin coated on the ETL via a two-step spin-coating programme with 1,000 r.p.m. for 10 s and 6,000 rpm for 30 s, respectively. Then 300 μl of antisolvent (α,α,α-trifluorotoluene) was dropped on the spinning substrates 20 s before the end of programme, followed by annealing at 85 °C for 45 min. The spiro-OMeTAD precursor solution was obtained via adding 72.3 mg of spiro-OMeTAD powder, 29 μl of TBP, 17.5 μl of Li-TFSI acetonitrile solution (520 mg ml−1) into chlorobenzene (1 ml). Afterwards, 50 μl of the spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin coated on the above perovskite films at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. The semicell was obtained successfully. Then 500 μl of carbon slurry based on rGO or Ti 1 –rGO was sprayed on the above semicells (FTO/ETL/perovskite/HTL) and FTO substrates on a hotplate at 85 °C to accelerate solvent evaporation. The obtained semicell A (FTO/ETL/perovskite/HTL/carbon) and charge collector B (FTO/ carbon) were then assembled into modular C-PSC by being stacked together using retaining clips, and the overall thickness of graphene on two carbon electrodes was compressed to about 2 μm.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalyst preparation details from a technical paragraph. Let me analyze this carefully.

First, I need to identify the catalyst being synthesized. The text mentions "Ti1–rGO SAM" - that's titanium single atoms on reduced graphene oxide. The synthesis involves a chemisorption route using titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) as the Ti source. 

Breaking down the synthesis procedure:
- Start with 400mg graphite oxide in 120ml isopropanol
- Add 20μl organic Ti salt with stirring
- Ultrasonic dispersion for 1 hour
- Magnetic stirring for 20 hours
- Centrifugation and vacuum drying at 85°C for 24h
- Calcination at 550°C under N2 for 2h

The control material is rGO prepared identically without Ti salt. The key catalyst here is clearly Ti1-rGO with atomically dispersed Ti.

The user also included perovskite solar cell fabrication details, but since they specifically asked about catalyst synthesis, I should focus only on the Ti1-rGO preparation. The solar cell parts seem to be context for how the catalyst is applied later.

As a chemistry professional, I should highlight:
- The single-atom nature of the catalyst
- The chemisorption mechanism
- Precise quantities and conditions
- The role of calcination in forming the final structure

I'll organize this into clear sections: catalyst identity, synthesis steps, and control material preparation. The summary should be technically precise but accessible to someone familiar with materials chemistry.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here's a professional chemist's summary of the synthesized catalyst and its detailed synthesis procedure:

**1. Catalyst Synthesized:**
*   **Name:** Ti₁–rGO SAM (Single-Atom Titanium on Reduced Graphene Oxide)
*   **Nature:** A single-atom catalyst (SAM = Single-Atom Material) where individual Titanium (Ti) atoms are anchored onto the surface of Reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO).
*   **Precursor:** Titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (Organic Ti salt).

**2. Detailed Synthesis Procedure for Ti₁–rGO SAM:**

1.  **Dispersion:** 400 mg of graphite oxide (GO) is dispersed in 120 ml of isopropanol (IPA).
2.  **Ti Precursor Addition:** 20 µl of the organic Ti salt (titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate)) is added to the GO/IPA dispersion under continuous magnetic stirring.
3.  **Mixing & Chemisorption:**
    *   The mixture is subjected to **ultrasonic dispersion for 1 hour**.
    *   Followed by **continuous magnetic stirring for 20 hours**. (This extended period allows for the chemisorption of Ti species onto the GO surface).
4.  **Separation:** The dispersion is centrifuged to separate the solid material.
5.  **Drying:** The resulting precipitate (solid) is dried under vacuum at **85 °C for 24 hours**.
6.  **Calcination/Reduction:** The dried powder is calcined at **550 °C for 2 hours** under a **high-purity N₂ atmosphere**. This step simultaneously:
    *   Reduces GO to rGO.
    *   Decomposes the organic ligands from the Ti precursor.
    *   Stabilizes the single Ti atoms onto the rGO support.
7.  **Product:** After cooling to room temperature, a **fluffy black powder** is obtained, identified as the Ti₁–rGO SAM catalyst.

**3. Control Material Synthesis (rGO):**
*   The procedure for synthesizing pure Reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO) is identical to steps 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 described above for Ti₁–rGO SAM.
*   The **critical difference** is that **no organic Ti salt is added** in step 2. Only graphite oxide is dispersed in IPA and processed through the same mixing, separation, drying, and calcination steps.

**Key Points from a Catalyst Synthesis Perspective:**

*   **Mechanism:** The synthesis relies on a **chemisorption route**, where the Ti precursor coordinates/reacts with functional groups on the GO surface during the extended stirring period.
*   **Single-Atom Formation:** The low concentration of Ti precursor (20 µl per 400 mg GO) combined with the chemisorption step and the stabilizing nature of the rGO support during high-temperature calcination under inert gas (N₂) promotes the formation of isolated, single Ti atoms rather than nanoparticles or clusters.
*   **Reduction/Activation:** The high-temperature (550°C) calcination in N₂ is essential for reducing GO to conductive rGO and removing organic residues from the Ti precursor, activating the Ti sites.
*   **Control:** Synthesizing rGO via the exact same procedure (minus Ti) provides a crucial control material to isolate the effect of the single Ti atoms in subsequent applications (like the described perovskite solar cells).

**Note:** The text also details the synthesis of other materials (c-TiO₂, mp-TiO₂, SnO₂, Perovskites, Spiro-OMeTAD) and the fabrication of solar cell architectures. However, based on your request, this summary focuses *exclusively* on the synthesis of the catalyst (Ti₁–rGO SAM) and its control material (rGO).
