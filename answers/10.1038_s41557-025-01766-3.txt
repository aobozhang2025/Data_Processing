question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Methods Synthesis of the Cu 1 /TiO 2 SAC Before Cu loading, TiO 2 powder was reduced by 10% H 2 /N 2 at 500 °C for 2 h to obtain reduced TiO 2 (TiO 2 -reduced). The Cu 1 /TiO 2 SAC was prepared using a modified photodeposition method, where the pho- todeposition process was performed by a high-power light-emitting diode (LED) lamp with a wavelength of 385 nm (Beijing Perfectlight, PL-LED100C). Typically, 200 mg of pretreated TiO 2 powder was dis- persed into 20 ml of ultrapure water, then 760 μl of Cu(NO 3 ) 2 ·3H 2 O (20 mg ml −1 ) aqueous solution was introduced into the mixture under vigorously stirring in a 100-ml beaker. The obtained suspension was then subject to UV illumination for 5 min at ambient temperature, with the operating current set to 0.8 A. Subsequently, the mixture was centrifuged and washed in ultrapure water twice, then dried overnight at 60 °C in an oven. The bulk sample was milled carefully using a quartz mortar to obtain fresh Cu 1 /TiO 2 SAC (Cu 1 /TiO 2 -fresh). The M/TiO 2 (M represents Ni, Fe, Co, Zn) and Cu-based catalysts were prepared by following the same procedures as Cu 1 /TiO 2 SAC.

Synthesis of the Cu/TiO 2 nanoparticle catalyst (Cu NP /TiO 2 ) Copper nanoparticles with an average diameter of 2 nm were fabri- cated using a modified solution chemistry. Typically, quantities of Cu(NO 3 ) 2 ·3H 2 O and l-ascorbic acid were dissolved in 10 ml of water, respectively, to obtain solution A (2 mmol Cu(NO 3 ) 2 ·3H 2 O aqueous solu- tion) and solution B (6 mmol l-ascorbic acid aqueous solution). Solution A was then transferred into a flask and heated to 80 °C in an oil bath, fol- lowed by dropwise addition of solution B into solution A with magnetic stirring. The mixture was maintained at 80 °C to ensure that all Cu ions in the solution were reduced quickly. Thirty minutes later, the heating was terminated, and the obtained colloid solution was used as the source of Cu nanoparticles (denoted solution C). Cu NP /TiO 2 was prepared by the incipient-wetness impregnation method. In a typical Cu NP /TiO 2 synthesis, 60 μl of solution C and 240 μl of water were simultane- ously added into 400 mg of the reduced TiO 2 powder with 10% H 2 /N 2 at 500 °C. After thorough mixing, the slurry was dried, milled, and calcined at 300 °C for 2 h to remove the redundant reactants.

Synthesis of the Cu/TiO 2 nanocluster catalyst (Cu cluster /TiO 2 ) The Cu nanoclusters were provided by C. Liu 42 . To synthesize Cu cluster / TiO 2 , 1 mg of Cu nanoclusters were dispersed in 0.5 ml of CH 2 Cl 2 , then further diluted in 5 ml of CH 3 OH. Subsequently, 200 mg of the afore- mentioned reduced TiO 2 powder was added. Following careful stirring, the mixture was dried overnight in an oven at 60 °C. The bulk sample was milled carefully using a quartz mortar to obtain Cu cluster /TiO 2 .

reasoning: 

Alright, the user wants me to act as a chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize the catalysts and their synthesis procedures from the provided paragraph. Let me break this down carefully.

First, I need to identify all catalysts mentioned. There are three main types: a copper single-atom catalyst on TiO2 (Cu1/TiO2 SAC), a copper nanoparticle catalyst (Cu NP/TiO2), and a copper nanocluster catalyst (Cu cluster/TiO2). The text also mentions that similar procedures were used for other metal SACs like Ni, Fe, Co, Zn on TiO2.

For the Cu1/TiO2 SAC synthesis, the key steps start with reducing the TiO2 support in hydrogen atmosphere. Then they use photodeposition with a specific 385nm LED lamp. Important details include the exact amounts - 200mg TiO2, 760μl of 20mg/ml Cu precursor, 5min irradiation at 0.8A. The washing and drying conditions are also crucial to report.

The nanoparticle catalyst synthesis is quite different - it involves chemically synthesizing Cu NPs first using ascorbic acid reduction at 80°C, then impregnating them onto TiO2. I should specify the NP size (2nm) and the precise solution concentrations. The calcination step at 300°C is important too.

For the nanocluster catalyst, I see it's simpler since they used pre-made clusters from another researcher. The synthesis is just dispersing the clusters and mixing with TiO2, followed by drying. The solvents used (dichloromethane and methanol) are worth noting.

The user seems to need this for academic or research purposes - maybe they're replicating the experiment or writing a review. I should maintain technical accuracy while making it digestible. They'll probably appreciate the inclusion of all quantitative details like temperatures, concentrations, and time durations since those are critical for reproducibility.

I notice the text references "M/TiO2" for other metals - I should clarify this refers to the same photodeposition method used for Cu SAC. Also, the TiO2 pretreatment (H2 reduction) is common to all catalysts, which is an important unifying point.

The challenge is presenting three distinct synthesis methods without confusion. I'll organize them separately with clear headings. The level of detail suggests the user values precision - so I'll keep all numbers and specific conditions intact while streamlining the language.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, three distinct copper-based catalysts supported on reduced TiO₂ were synthesized, along with analogous catalysts for other metals (Ni, Fe, Co, Zn). Here's a detailed summary of the catalysts and their synthesis procedures:

**1. Catalyst Synthesized: Cu Single-Atom Catalyst on TiO₂ (Cu₁/TiO₂ SAC)**
    *   **Support Pretreatment:** TiO₂ powder was reduced in a 10% H₂/N₂ gas mixture at 500 °C for 2 hours to obtain "TiO₂-reduced".
    *   **Method:** Modified Photodeposition.
    *   **Procedure Details:**
        1.  Disperse 200 mg of pretreated TiO₂-reduced powder into 20 ml of ultrapure water in a 100-ml beaker.
        2.  Add 760 μl of an aqueous solution of Cu(NO₃)₂·3H₂O (concentration: 20 mg ml⁻¹) to the suspension under vigorous stirring.
        3.  Illuminate the suspension with a high-power LED lamp (wavelength: 385 nm; model: PL-LED100C, Beijing Perfectlight) for 5 minutes at ambient temperature. The operating current was set to 0.8 A.
        4.  Centrifuge the mixture to separate the solid catalyst.
        5.  Wash the solid twice with ultrapure water.
        6.  Dry the washed solid overnight in an oven at 60 °C.
        7.  Carefully mill the dried bulk sample using a quartz mortar to obtain the final catalyst, denoted as "Cu₁/TiO₂-fresh".
    *   **Analogous Catalysts:** The same photodeposition procedure (steps 1-7 above) was used to synthesize M/TiO₂ SACs where M = Ni, Fe, Co, or Zn, using their respective nitrate precursors instead of Cu(NO₃)₂·3H₂O.

**2. Catalyst Synthesized: Cu Nanoparticle Catalyst on TiO₂ (Cu NP/TiO₂)**
    *   **Support Pretreatment:** TiO₂ powder was reduced in a 10% H₂/N₂ gas mixture at 500 °C for 2 hours to obtain "TiO₂-reduced" (same as for SAC).
    *   **Method:** Solution Synthesis of NPs followed by Incipient-Wetness Impregnation.
    *   **Procedure Details:**
        *   **Synthesis of Cu Nanoparticles (Solution C):**
            1.  Dissolve Cu(NO₃)₂·3H₂O in 10 ml water to make Solution A (2 mmol Cu(NO₃)₂·3H₂O).
            2.  Dissolve L-ascorbic acid in 10 ml water to make Solution B (6 mmol L-ascorbic acid).
            3.  Transfer Solution A to a flask and heat to 80 °C in an oil bath with magnetic stirring.
            4.  Add Solution B dropwise to the heated Solution A.
            5.  Maintain the mixture at 80 °C for 30 minutes to ensure complete reduction of Cu²⁺ ions to form copper nanoparticles (~2 nm average diameter).
            6.  Stop heating. The resulting colloid is "Solution C" (source of Cu NPs).
        *   **Loading NPs onto TiO₂:**
            1.  Simultaneously add 60 μl of Solution C and 240 μl of ultrapure water to 400 mg of pretreated TiO₂-reduced powder.
            2.  Mix thoroughly to ensure even impregnation.
            3.  Dry the resulting slurry.
            4.  Mill the dried material.
            5.  Calcinate the milled material at 300 °C for 2 hours in air to remove residual reactants/organics.

**3. Catalyst Synthesized: Cu Nanocluster Catalyst on TiO₂ (Cu cluster/TiO₂)**
    *   **Support Pretreatment:** TiO₂ powder was reduced in a 10% H₂/N₂ gas mixture at 500 °C for 2 hours to obtain "TiO₂-reduced" (same as others).
    *   **Method:** Dispersion and Adsorption of Pre-formed Nanoclusters.
    *   **Procedure Details:**
        1.  Disperse 1 mg of pre-synthesized Cu nanoclusters (source: C. Liu) in 0.5 ml of dichloromethane (CH₂Cl₂).
        2.  Dilute the dispersion further by adding 5 ml of methanol (CH₃OH).
        3.  Add 200 mg of pretreated TiO₂-reduced powder to the diluted nanocluster dispersion.
        4.  Stir the mixture carefully.
        5.  Dry the mixture overnight in an oven at 60 °C.
        6.  Carefully mill the dried bulk sample using a quartz mortar to obtain the final Cu cluster/TiO₂ catalyst.

**Key Commonality:** All three catalyst syntheses utilize **reduced TiO₂ (TiO₂-reduced)** as the support, prepared by treating TiO₂ powder in 10% H₂/N₂ at 500 °C for 2 hours before any metal loading. The metal deposition methods, however, are distinctly different (photodeposition for SACs, solution synthesis + impregnation for NPs, dispersion for clusters).
