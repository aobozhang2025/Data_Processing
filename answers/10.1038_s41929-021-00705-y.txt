question: 

Imagine you are a chemist that is a professional in synthesizing catalysts, please summarize what catalyst is synthesized and the synthesis procedures with all the details from the following paragraph: 

Synthesis of CoPc/CNT. CoPc/CNT was synthesized following an analogous protocol reported in the literature73. CoPc (1 mg) was mixed with 30 mg of a multiwall CNT in 30 ml dimethylformamide solution and stirred for 24 h. The suspension became transparent. The final suspension was washed using EtOH and H 2 O within a centrifuge to remove the dimethylformamide, and after that was freeze-dried to give the final catalyst.

Synthesis. The polyaniline-derived NiNC catalyst is identical to that reported in our previous studies71,72. Aniline (3 ml), NiCl 2 ·6H 2 O (5 g) and ammonium persulfate (5 g) were added to 0.5 l of 1 M HCl and stirred for 1 h. This suspension was then mixed with 0.4 g of a dispersed activated Ketjen 600 carbon black support (washed in HCl for purification and HNO 3 for oxygen doping), stirred for 48 h and then dried in the air at 95 °C for 24 h. The residual solid-state mixture was ball milled with Zr 2 O 3 balls for 20 min. We conducted the pyrolysis protocol in a furnace at 900 °C (ramp of 30 °C min–1) for 1 h under N 2 conditions, followed by acid washing steps (2 M H 2 SO 4 at 90 °C overnight) to remove the excessive Ni particles. We performed heat treatment four times and acid washing three times and the catalyst was obtained after the fourth pyrolysis.

reasoning: 

Okay, the user wants me to act as a professional chemist specializing in catalyst synthesis and summarize two catalyst synthesis procedures from a provided paragraph. Let me carefully analyze both syntheses.

First, for the CoPc/CNT catalyst: It's a cobalt phthalocyanine supported on multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The key steps involve dissolving CoPc in DMF, mixing with CNTs, stirring for 24 hours until transparent, then washing with ethanol and water via centrifugation to remove DMF, followed by freeze-drying. The transparency suggests molecular dispersion rather than simple adsorption.

Now for the more complex NiNC catalyst: This is a nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst with nickel, derived from polyaniline. The synthesis starts with polymerizing aniline with NiCl2 and ammonium persulfate in HCl. Then they add acid-treated Ketjen carbon black, dry it, ball mill with zirconia balls, and go through multiple pyrolysis-acid washing cycles. The pyrolysis is at 900°C under nitrogen with fast ramping, and acid washing removes excess nickel. They specifically mention four heat treatments and three acid washes, with the catalyst obtained after the fourth pyrolysis.

The user seems to need precise technical details - probably for replication or research purposes. I should highlight critical parameters like concentrations, temperatures, times, and the repetition of pyrolysis/washing cycles which is unusual but crucial for the NiNC catalyst. I'll organize this clearly by catalyst and include all specifications while maintaining professional terminology.

answer: 

Based on the provided text, here are the synthesized catalysts and their detailed synthesis procedures, summarized by a professional catalyst chemist:

**1. Catalyst Synthesized: Cobalt Phthalocyanine supported on Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (CoPc/CNT)**
    *   **Synthesis Procedure:**
        1.  **Dissolution & Mixing:** 1 mg of Cobalt Phthalocyanine (CoPc) is dissolved/mixed with 30 mg of multi-walled Carbon Nanotubes (CNT) in 30 ml of Dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent.
        2.  **Stirring:** The mixture is stirred for 24 hours at room temperature. The suspension becomes transparent, indicating molecular dispersion/adsorption.
        3.  **Washing:** The resulting suspension is washed using Ethanol (EtOH) and Water (H₂O) to remove residual DMF. Washing is performed using centrifugation to separate the solid catalyst from the wash liquids.
        4.  **Drying:** The washed solid catalyst is freeze-dried to remove all solvent and water, yielding the final CoPc/CNT catalyst as a dry powder.

**2. Catalyst Synthesized: Polyaniline-Derived Nickel-Nitrogen-Doped Carbon on Ketjen Black (NiNC)**
    *   **Synthesis Procedure:**
        1.  **Polymerization:** 3 ml of Aniline monomer and 5 g of Nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate (NiCl₂·6H₂O) are added to 0.5 liters of 1 M Hydrochloric Acid (HCl) solution. 5 g of Ammonium Persulfate ((NH₄)₂S₂O₈) is added to initiate polymerization. The mixture is stirred for 1 hour at room temperature to form polyaniline (PANI) incorporating Ni²⁺ ions.
        2.  **Support Addition:** 0.4 g of pre-treated activated Ketjen EC-600JD carbon black is added to the PANI-Ni suspension. The carbon black was pre-washed with HCl (for purification) and HNO₃ (for oxygen doping/surface functionalization). The mixture is stirred for 48 hours at room temperature to allow adsorption/composite formation.
        3.  **Drying:** The suspension is dried in air at 95 °C for 24 hours to remove moisture and form a solid composite.
        4.  **Milling:** The dried solid composite is ball-milled for 20 minutes using ZrO₂ (Zirconia) balls to homogenize particle size.
        5.  **Pyrolysis & Acid Leaching Cycles (Repeated):** The milled powder undergoes a specific thermal and chemical treatment cycle, repeated multiple times:
            *   **Pyrolysis:** Heated in a tube furnace under flowing Nitrogen (N₂) atmosphere. The temperature is ramped to 900 °C at a rate of 30 °C per minute and held at 900 °C for 1 hour. This carbonizes the PANI, forms N-doped carbon, and reduces/sinters Ni species.
            *   **Acid Washing:** After cooling, the pyrolyzed material is washed in 2 M Sulfuric Acid (H₂SO₄) at 90 °C overnight to dissolve and remove unstable/excess metallic Nickel particles.
        6.  **Final Product:** The specific sequence performed was: **Four Pyrolysis steps** and **Three Acid Washing steps**. The catalyst is obtained after the completion of the **fourth pyrolysis step**. (Note: Acid washing typically follows pyrolysis, so the sequence was likely: Pyrolysis 1 -> Wash 1 -> Pyrolysis 2 -> Wash 2 -> Pyrolysis 3 -> Wash 3 -> Pyrolysis 4 -> Final Catalyst).

**Key Details Emphasized:**

*   **CoPc/CNT:** Precise masses (1 mg CoPc, 30 mg CNT), solvent volume (30 ml DMF), stirring time (24 h), washing solvents (EtOH, H₂O), washing method (centrifugation), drying method (freeze-drying).
*   **NiNC:** Precise quantities (3 ml Aniline, 5 g NiCl₂·6H₂O, 5 g (NH₄)₂S₂O₈, 0.5 l 1M HCl, 0.4 g Ketjen), polymerization time (1 h), support pre-treatment (HCl wash, HNO₃ doping), composite stirring time (48 h), drying conditions (95 °C, 24 h, air), milling details (ZrO₂ balls, 20 min), pyrolysis conditions (900 °C, 30 °C/min ramp, 1 h hold, N₂ atmosphere), acid washing conditions (2 M H₂SO₄, 90 °C, overnight), and critically, the **number of cycles** (4x pyrolysis, 3x acid washing, catalyst collected after 4th pyrolysis).
